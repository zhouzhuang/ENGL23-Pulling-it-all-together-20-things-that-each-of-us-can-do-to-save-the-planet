Here's a written list of the solutions:
<br><br>
1. eat a plant-based diet (vegan or freegan) and limit food waste
<br><br>
2. be conscious with your food choices (ex. it's harmful to eat asparagus in the winter) 
<br><br>
3. use contraception 
<br><br>
4. educate boys and girls fairly
<br><br>
5. walk or bike instead of driving, or use a car minimally
<br><br>
6. live mindfully (in smaller homes, micro-apartments, or co-housing)
<br><br>
7. choose slow travel (driving, trains) over air travel 
<br><br>
8. practice some form of minimalism (only buying what you need)
<br><br>
<br><br>
9. repair, trade, or rent instead of buying new things
<br><br>
10. buy from companies with environmentally-sound and socially just practices
<br><br>
11. vote for candidates who advocate for sweeping climate policies
<br><br>
12. vote for environmental initiatives 
<br><br>
13. tell people about the climate crisis, explain the solutions and the importance of voting
<br><br>
14. gather and create powerful groups of activists and change-makers 
<br><br>
15. protest and take power away from enemies of the environment
<br><br>
16. read and educate yourself about skills you can take on  
<br><br>
17. think about why this is so important in order to maintain or revitalize your passion for the cause
<br><br>
18. use knowledge to share and implement solutions
<br><br>
19. join with initiatives such as freegan and bicycle collectives to create a larger support system for the climate crisis
<br><br>
20. become the change you want to see in the world
<br><br>

In "Happy", they talk about two intrinsic goals being the true sources of everlasting happiness. These two intrinsic goals are personal growth and community feeling. Every single solution on the list deals with at least one of the two intrinsic goals. 
<br><br>

In "Being the Change", they also talk about how the best motivations are intrinsic motivations, or things that align with your own morals/values. They concluded that people who do "environmental things" are happier because they have more meaning in their lives. In "Minimalism", they talk about how people are always on the hunt, and how minimalism can allow an individual to rid themselves of restless and selfish feelings and focus on the greater value of life. As Hannah Montana once sang, "We all want to believe in love. We all want to believe in something bigger than just us. We all want to be a part of the greater picture that's hanging in our hearts. It's bigger than us." 
<br><br>

I believe that the most important solution is #17. I am a firm believer that if you truly want something, you will do whatever it takes to make it happen. Therefore, if you reflect on why this is so important to you, you revive the desire, concern, passion, and motivation necessary to enact change. As Miley Cyrus once sang, "I put my back into and my heart in it so I did it, yeah, I did it."

I believe that passion is the strongest emotion to move anyone after the great emotion of fear, especially when it comes to the climate change activist and those who understand the greater danger we are bringing our world into. The problem that stems between the the believers and non-believers is passion, as in the end when the world has hit the fan and everyone is in fear, but away from the grim. Passion is what divides us, and what keeps us going when it comes to activism. I see that solution #17 is the most important to me as well because passion is what keeps everyone motivated to pursue what they know is a great danger to our planet.
<br><br>
On top of that, I view that educating people on the topic a the same tier as I do as passion as most people don't understand the deeper context that lie behind climate change than just the polar caps melting away. That is a problem that I see all across the United States where the populous isn't educated enough on the topic to gain the passion needed to bring change on a wider scale all across the United States. With the lack of education on the topic opens the windows the think tanks, who are working for the major fossil fuel industries, are able to fill in the gap and fill the people of the United States with the wrong passion that goes against the right action to save the planet from humanity's greater harm. 
<br><br>
Thus my view on passion and education are on par as both can go hand and hand in motivating people to take up arms against the major fossil industries that pose as a major threat to the planet as a whole and getting people to understand the deeper context of the Climate Crisis would invoke a sense of passion to take on the problems we are laying on our greater home we call Earth.
<br><hr>
Thank you for your written list! I was trying to create a list myself but it was hard to keep up with each point, especially because I was trying to focus on the content of the video itself rather than try to take notes as fast as possible. I also really appreciate the connection that you made with the list and “Happy” because I believe that we must try to look at the climate crisis as a way, a chance to better our community and ourselves. If we view the climate crisis as problematic and something that we have to fix, we will end up having a negative mindset about changing our lives and then our world may descend into chaos and darkness.
<br><br>

I agree that #17 on this list is one of the most important things that each person can do but it’s going to take alot to convince the world to truly treat the climate crisis as a serious issue that they each have to play a part in solving. Specifically for me, I consider number 4 to be the most important/ most feasible action that we can take because women in this day and age are working even harder for more rights and the truth is, how are we supposed to implement more environmental ways into our separate societies if we can’t even offer everyone in our world the same rights? We must make sure that women everywhere are allowed to be educated past an elementary level and only then will everything slowly fall into place. Of course, adding a carbon tax is quick and direct and will cut down CO2 emissions but I don’t think that our current society is even prepared to receive such a tax- my guess is that there would be mass outrage and more politicking would be down to shut down the carbon tax and then we would be back to square 1.

<br><hr>
I don’t know what I love more- YOUR COMMENT or the fact that you quoted a Miley Cyrus song lol. I love it. While I greatly appreciated your written out solutions, I do disagree with you in one sense. That being, the most important part. While you suggest it is finding a passion for your cause, I would argue that it is teaching boys and girls the same. 
<br><br>

This solution is far greater than climate change. This idea needs to be spread and promoted everywhere. Girls and boys are not being treated equally in school, in work, and in life. It is completely unfair and if we must start with climate change, than so be it. 
<br><br>

I think the easiest solution is to live mindfully. This goes hand in hand with speaking up. The more we bring up the conversation and get people talking, the more people will think about what they are doing and eating. Conversation creates a sense of guilt. 
<br><br>

Also in light of this week’s festivities, I would like to say that without this class, I think I would’ve voted for the wrong people. One of the most valuable pieces of information I gained from this class was about all of the bad companies that were backing the campaigns of the people my family votes for. Horrible. On Tuesday, I changed that around
<br><hr>
I think that in summing up the most important message of all that we’ve learned in this class, you’ve hit the nail on the head. This comment (which is obviously made 10x better by the addition of MileyCyrus/Hannah Montana quotes) connected many of the films to these 20 suggestions in a way that I hadn’t even thought about. You are absolutely right. Happiness is  the goal after all isn’t it? Happiness for ourselves, happiness for others, and happiness for the planet we inhabit is what we’re all searching for. However, what I’ve come to realize in taking this class is that overall, most people are motivated by selfishness. In some way almost everything we do as humans is for personal benefit. When we are threatened we take action against whatever may be threatening us because we are programmed for self-preservation over all else. Even more so in America than in other countries, we can see the drive of selfishness as what is pushing most people forward in life. The way in which we can convince people to take action is by simply appealing to the selfish tendencies of humans. How can we survive if our planet doesn’t? How can we be happy if we can’t survive? Well, the obvious first step is to start with saving our planet. Maybe people just need to feel threatened in some way in order to nudge them to change.
<br><hr>
First off, I love your Hannah Montana reference. "Bigger than Us" is an underrated one. Also, thank you for putting together a clear list of all the steps that Ken went over. This was really helpful to look at while I was watching it for the first time. I do agree that number 17 is a very important step, but I also think there is a lot of value in number 16. I feel like so many facts and statistics are thrown around, we need to be clear on what is fact and what is not. We also need to ask ourselves where are these numbers coming from and how were they taken. As anyone who has taken a stats class knows, it is really easy just to see numbers and believe them without even checking how the survey or test was conducted. Also, of course voting is huge as Ken has emphasized. Although we do have our own bodies to control, government holds the true power and can make a huge impact on the situation. It is not enough for one person to change their diet. Voting is a much louder change than simply cutting off beef.

<br><hr>
Thank you for listing the solutions in a list, that really helps bring everything to the light. I would like to focus on the first ten. These are personal actions which we can adopt in our own lives. There are some acts that may contribute more / have a greater impact than others, but all are important.
<br><br>

Though the first ten solutions are ten personal actions, they reflect five tips given earlier in the course. These five recommendations had to do with transportation, housing, food, amount of children, and minimizing consumerism. Transportation relates back to #5 (walk or bike instead of driving, or use a car minimally) and #7 choose slow travel (driving, trains) over air travel. Travel makes up a quarter of our carbon footprint and instead of driving and even flying everywhere for our convenience, we should take up public transportation and biking / walking. As a college student, I’ve experienced the shift of having my family’s car to my convenience to traveling on the bus, biking to school, and walking around IV and campus. It’s definitely a benefit for us students to take the bus for free and I feel very grateful for it. I actually love the fact that I have public transportation and even bike more (the commute from Santa Catalina and back really burns those extra dining common calories) and when using it here, I wondered why we don’t emphasize city buses and bikes to our advantage. I think public transportation should become more of a priority because at times it is not always efficient, yet the more credible it becomes, the more people will feel safe and reassured when deciding to use it.
<br><br>

Throughout the class, it’s repeated over and over again how we eat has a strong effect on climate change. We are prompted to eat a plant-based diet more and more, as #1 proposes. Ken says it himself in this lecture: being vegan or freegan is good, but practicing both is great. It’s also worth noting to not waste food, or limit food waste as much as possible. At the dining commons, I can be guilty of grabbing too much and wasting an extent of food which is not good! It’s something I need to work on. Moreover, being conscious of your food choices didn’t seem so surprising initially, right before Ken emphasized considering which foods are harmful to eat during certain seasons. Your comment uses the example of how it’s harmful to eat asparagus in the winter and that is the kind of knowledge I haven’t gotten out of my way to learn. From this day forward, I will keep in mind what is not in season and could be detrimental for the environment to support buying at a bad time.
<br><br>

Housing is only underscored in one single point. This is #6 that recites to live mindfully in smaller homes, micro-apartments, or co-housing. Housing makes up another quarter of our carbon footprint. I always saw the ability to own a home as top tier accomplishment, but a minimal apartment could also be really nice. If I do happen to live in the city, it would go hand in hand with the first recommendation as I would expect myself to use my car less in exchange for public transportation and take on more eco-friendly, efficient housing. Also, from my dorm experience, co-housing does not seem as hard. I think these options are more realistic than we think, but pride and privilege come to play.
<br><br>

Buying less, sharing things, and keeping things for longer -- this concept comes from #8 (practice some form of minimalism) and #9 (repair, trade, or rent instead of buying new things). Thrift stores are growing more in fame and are considered hip and I find that to be a good thing. There are more ‘pop-up thrift stores’ and just in general, more sharing. I know fast fashion leads to harmful effects for our common home as well as injustice for hard working laborers in third world countries.
<br><br>

As for children, I actually want to adopt and that would help bring zero humans into the earth while providing for those already here. I understand not everyone would like to adopt -- I do recommend it to be an idea in consideration at least -- but all aspiring parents should consider how great of a life could they provide their children in an overpopulated, deteriorating world.

<br><hr>
I agree with this comment completely, most people I meet and talk to fully believe and support that the climate crisis is real and needs to be dealt with immediately. However, they do nothing, or make any changes in their lifestyle to support this statement; again, knowledge is not power if not acted upon. Earlier I was speaking to my sister about how I was taking a class about climate change and how it was not a science class but centered around the cultural and social issues that drive it. She then responded "sounds like trash" but then followed with how she thought it was a real issue and really needs to be dealt with, which is why she will be voting for the next election. It did not add up to me how she could vote and support but not fully understand that our societal ideals drive this climate issue.
<br><br>
I understand that making lifestyle changes may be difficult for many people, especially transportation, considering we live in LA and it's extremely difficult and dangerous to get around without driving. But a small change like a change in diet and change the attitude of many and lead to great change within a community. Acting on what you believe in is a key role in beginning a change. Without this motivation and belief, no change would ever get started. After taking this class I will try to do what I can to lower my carbon footprint, as the solutions listed are not difficult and completely doable.
<br><hr>
Through collection, we can find that there are many things we can do to make our own contribution to climate change. Although the effect will not be particularly obvious, at least we have done our part. For example, we can do more walking and cycling to drive less, live in smaller houses, talk about the importance of protecting the environment with the people around us and appeal for more people to join in. Although I have questioned the importance of eating less beef all the time, compared with the fact that there is not much change when one does not eat beef, but it is a waste in my eyes, but we can still do not waste food, and we can choose to travel by train rather than by plane when the situation is not urgent. Maybe there are not so many people in my country who have known or had the opportunity to understand the urgency of protecting the environment or the way they can do it, so I would like to let them know this, and call on them to do it by themselves to reduce carbon emissions.

<br><hr>
I definitely agree that the most important is number 17 because you must have passion and drive in order to keep something going but additionally I also believe that 18 is second to that, because it allows informs others and allows change to be made by not just yourself. These solutions, not only apply to our intrinsic motivation because this is intrinsic goals is the best way to achieve what must be done. Our goals also have to align our morals and values because there is something so motivating and life changing when you realize that you contribute greatly to something meaningful. 
<br><br>

All of these goals match the material we have been given, from "Being the Change" to "Minimalism", Ken has given us material to see not only why we should do the things we do but how. This class greatly opened my eyes to possible alternatives that we need and made me realize how insane the whole Climate Crisis ordeal is from people skewing data in facts to not believe in climate change to realizing that environmental injustice is very frequent in occurring. We are the change that must be made in the world, tackling one thing at a time at least changes us so drastically.
<br><hr>
Thank you for writing out the list, as I was watching the video I had forgotten some of the items and it is super helpful to have them on hand immediately after. I agree that #17 (reflecting on our actions and the issues you find important) is vital to maintaining enthusiasm and motivation to keep acting in regard to climate change. I grew up in a family that believed in climate change and had my siblings and I watch documentaries about how to be healthy and limit our footprint but as I got older I had stopped thinking about how I could limit my footprint. I still thought about climate change and wanted politicians to create laws that would limit emissions but I didn’t necessarily think about how I could enact change (other than through voting and driving less). This class has definitely made me think more about my actions and what I can do personally.
<br><hr>
Thank you for listing the different things we can do! I agree with your comment that #17 is extremely important in motivating people to stay informed and passionate about fighting climate change. Like many things, such as school, it is hard to see the bigger picture. Many times I don't want to do assignments or go to the library to get my work done, but then I remember that having good grades is much more rewarding in the end, and will benefit my future. This can be found in instilling climate action, as people may find it inconvenient to bike to work or change the way they eat things or where they buy their clothes from. However, all these changes are necessary for us to have a healthy planet, a planet that will be able to sustain our children and our children's children for decades to come. I liked how you tied in the other assignments of the week with this, as they tie in nicely with the concept of motivation. Being in a positive environment that is fulfilled, surrounded by people who are motivated and successful is the best inspiration. The climate crisis does not have to be always seen in a negative light, as we can use it as an opportunity to create a better world for us all.
<br><hr>
I really appreciate you taking the time to write out the list! It is extremely helpful! I definitely agree with your claim that the most important solution in #17. I think that if people don't take the time to remind themselves why it is important that they are making all of these changes in their lives, it is extremely easy to drift away from these changes and go back to the easy lifestyle that most Americans live. I think that people often forget or get discouraged because it is not an easy or fast process. It's going to take years to see the improvement in our environment after people make these changes, and I believe that is one of the main reasons people forget why they are fighting for this cause. However, it is extremely important to stay fighting for the cause because it is the only way that we are going to be able to make a real change for our environment. 
<br><br>
Another solution that I think is extremely important is #3. Having access to and using contraception is extremely important in order to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Preventing unwanted pregnancies is important for the climate crisis because it helps keep our population in check. Giving women access to birth control methods is crucial, specially since in many countries abortion is not an option, therefore prevention is key. I think that this is issue should really be addressed in order to provide women around the world access to birth control and have them be in charge of their reproductive health, and eventually make it possible for women all over the world to have access to abortion.

<br><hr>
Thank you for compiling everything in the video into this very concise list. It makes it very convenient to run it back without having to scrub through the video. I like that you connect the 20 things we can do to save the planet to things we can do to make us happier. This further strengthens the thoughts that we can become happier and save the planet for every living species at the same time. It's a win-win, so why wouldn't we work towards it? I really like how the entire class is tieing together, all of the films' and Youtube videos' messages working to provide us with a solution that will benefit everyone personally (happiness) and on a larger scale (stopping climate change).

<br><br>

I agree that #17 is a very important point. Without passion, the movement to countering the climate crisis will not get anywhere. We will not be able to work for and complete the other 19 goals without really wanting to do it. Reflecting on how important this work is will help to revitalize our passion and in turn, bring us one step closer to a better planet.

<br><hr>
I think that anyone who quotes Hannah Montana in their comment clearly has sumn good to say. With that being said, I also think that reflecting on the cause and revitalizing your passion for it is something that is extremely important. I think that making some of these lifestyle changes can be really hard to do, and ultimately really difficult to stay motivated to keep with. Understanding why you are doing what you are doing and reinvigorating your passion for the cause is something that is completely necessary if we want to maintain our goals and the planet. I found this video to be valuable and a tool that we as a class had been looking forward to utilizing- we initially took this class because we were looking for resources/a guideline on how we can save the planet and how we can educate others on how to live more sustainable lives. From this course, I've gathered that we just need to be mindful of our choices and conscious about the effects of the decisions we make. With this mindset, the way we eat would completely change, the amount of clothes and random things we buy would drastically decrease... I find there to be so many benefits to this shift in our paradigm.
<br><hr>
Thank you for making this list in writing! I personally need to work on number 1. Specifically, I need to work on lowering my food waste. Although I adhere to a largely plant-based diet, I often am guilt of letting leftovers sit in the refrigerator for too long, or I buy a carton of eggs and do not eat them, thereby contributing to food waste unnecessarily. In my case, this is a matter of discipline. I must eat first what I have and not give into impulses to buy food whenever I feel the urge. It is also a matter of foresight. If I see myself maybe not eating something immediately, I can freeze it until I am too broke to go out to eat and have a meal ready for when that time comes. 
<br><br>

I also plan to do more research into what companies have environmentally sound and socially just practices. This takes a certain amount of critical thinking, because often companies greenwash their brands in marketing schemes. We must not take what companies claim at face value, but look behind the curtain. What are they doing with their waste? What are their worksites' health and safety practices like? Do they pay employees a living wage? These are all important questions to ask when deciding who to buy from.

<br><hr>


Thank you for listing all 20 things, you did a great job summarizing all the points he made.
<br><br>
If I had to only choose 5 of those items in the the list to tell someone, they would be: plant-based diet, girl education, live mindfully, practice some form of minimalism and vote for environmental initiatives. 
<br><br>
I would reword the first item as to emphasize cutting beef out of one's diet as its contribution to emissions is disproportional compared to other meats. I would make sure to illustrate the absurdity of the tolls of the beef industry on the planet aside from emissions and use graphs that help illustrate the sheer numbers involved. I say this as I think people will most likely respond better to cutting out some form of meat rather than cutting out animal products entirely. Although this may come off as giving up, I think its a much better way of getting people to actually make a change. Meat consumption is still a rampant part of our culture and any effort to stop it in in tracks is ill fated. I think being realistic and having an aggressive campaign against the main antagonist meat product is the answer to getting the most people possible involved and it also acts as starting point for decreasing individual animal product consumption. Ideals are very important but compromises need to be made to actually achieve goals.
<br><br>
I would also reword girl education to population control. Female sex education is one area that I think will not change from any conscious will in the West as it involves a complete revolution in thinking within hardline religious culture.
<br><br>
As for the last 3 items, I hope that they will come as part of a new sweeping cultural shift.
<br><br>
I agree that solution 17 is a key tool, but I think it won't apply to to most people who will switch to environmentally friendly due to policy changes or economic reasons.


<br><hr>
These twenty things serve as a kind of summary of what we need to do as an individual action and collective action. Individual actions are hard to persist and make little changes individually, but collective actions require a great amount of time to succeed and even then the successful rate is quite low. Neither of these two are easy ways to work out climate changes and we have to do these things now. Also, Ken mentions in his video that technology itself cannot work out the problem, and I think he has talked about this many times, but I think it is quite necessary. Because we are all well-educated students, and we get involved in technological perspectives and may think that these techs are the major factors to work out of climate changes.However, that is definitely not the case, since even the rapid development after WWII didn’t stop co2 emission from skyrocked, the increase in tech efficiency may only be a disadvantage alone, to make people more greedy and consume more things as granted. Therefore, the fundamental cure for environmental protection is to arouse and alter people’s intrinsic desires of being greedy, and I am quite confident that these things can be regulated and controlled by our consciousness.
<br><hr>
Thank you for listing out the methods presented by Ken. I really loved this video because it showed the interconnectedness of political, social and economic action. Firstly, saving the planet starts at the table. By choosing to eat a mainly plant based meal the demand for beef will reduce and so will methane emissions. We should only buy what we know we are going to eat and nothing more. We should start as climaterianists and eat with the planet in mind. Secondly, we need to reduce the number of children we have. The promotion of birth control and education for girls because the more education a woman has the less children she has. Institutions that restrict birth control must be reformed. Next, by walking or biking to work instead of using a car you will reduce your carbon footprint as well as ceasing to travel by plane. By moving to a microapartment or a smaller space this can also be accomplished. We need to rethink our shopping habits and adopt a minimalist lifestyle, its a first world solution to a first world problem. By promoting climate and environmental activism we can inspire people all over the world to make these changes one at a time. Overall, I believe we need to promote the awareness that we will not just be saving the planet for ourselves as humans but all manners of life that we share this beautiful earth with.

<br><hr>
First of all, I want to thank Ken for such a wonderful and informative course. This has been the first course I've taken at UCSB which has made me aware of the real threat of climate crisis and the things I can do to change the way I live. As Leanne said, I believe passion is one of our strongest and most powerful motivations to do anything. When someone is passionate, you do anything to achieve whichever goal you have in mind. You work twice as hard. You have double the energy and you are happy while doing so. If we are not passionate about changing the way we live, or passionate about mitigating climate crisis then we will not be able to do anything. Yes, we might be able to start changing our lives, but we will give up sooner or later because we are not passionate about it. To be passionate means to be face every hardship with a straight face and move on. Sometimes it might seem hard to continue, but the end result will be rewarding. You do not have to be passionate for yourselves, but for other people such as your kids. Would you want your kids to live on an earth that is polluted and where respiratory diseases are considered "the new flue"? I would certainly hope not. Ken summarized all the key points of the things we can do to save our planet both in a personal and collective level. These two categories are dependent on each other and without one or the other, we will not achieve the change we want to see in the world. Many believe that we require new technology to save us from an apocalyptic world, yet this is not entirely the case. We need personal, cultural, and political changes that encourage everyone in our society to change and become passionate about saving our world. "You are the music while the music lasts"--T.S. Eliot Do you want to be the kind of music that brings pain and suffering to future generations? or do you want to be the music that inspires future generations? It's up to you to decide what kind of music you want to leave as your legacy.
<br><hr>
First, thank you for making a list, very appreciated. 
<br><br>


While watching the film "Happy" I was reminded of the Ecovista people from lecture,  they are part of the change and they are part of a community, they seem to be exactly what the film "Happy" was talking about.  When I first heard about climate change right after I tried my hardest to be the most environmentally friendly, this was in middle school, but all I knew then was don't waste water and don't leave your charger plugged in. Taking this course has shown me so many ways in which I can be environmentally friendly and also ways that I am already being environmentally friendly without even knowing.  This course has taught me a lot on how I can become an ally to the earth and it has greatly affected my lifestyle choices, I believe a climate crisis class for all schools and universities should be a requirement, no one should be left in the unknown. The more people that we can get to the more people will start to make a change.
<br><hr>
I love your reference!! In all seriousness though, I think Miley would approve of your comment. I think that many people, myself included, often set goals for ourselves and at some point, forget why we set that goal in the first place. I think it's very important that we take time to look back and remember exactly why we are trying to make these changes (and this applies not only to climate change, but just our day to day lives). If you do that, then your more likely to stay on track and be persistent with the change that you're trying to enact. Hopefully, by doing that, along with the other 19 items on the list, our society will be able to cause effective change before it's too late.
<br><hr>
I personally believe that number 15 is the most important solution. Our world is run by enemies of the environment. Our government is set up in a way that protects these enemies and many of the largest companies gain large sums of money by being an enemy of the environment. By protesting we are showing that we speak for the majority of humankind instead of the small few who benefit fiscally from the release of vast amounts of carbon into our atmosphere. I have thought about this problem a lot and it really shows how small and insignificant we are in the grand scheme of things, as these major companies can control our lives. However, with protesting, we become a unit that is able to contest the large companies and show them we are not to be messed with.
<br><br>


I would also like to add that number 13 is extremely important as well. More people need to know the severity of the climate crisis, because that is the only way we will be able to see changes in the small timespan that we have. If we don't make big changes soon, we will never be able to save our Earth in the way that we should, or maybe even at all. Letting people in on the truth of the matter, which is that the Earth is in peril, will allow us to get the numbers needed to make change and they will want to do it in the right amount of time. Telling people the importance of voting will also definitely help, because I know I only voted on Super Tuesday because of this class educating me that voting is the number 1 thing to do.

I like you list these 20 points out because it makes the solution even easier for us. And if we can take a good look at these 20 things, we will know it is not anything very hard to do. It is a science class require you a Phd degree to work and make the situation better. Instead, it is really just all about common sense that we know already. Stop wasting food, turn off your light and drive less. These things are the most easy thing ever we can make change right now. It is not we do not know how, it is about do we want to make improvements today. It does not require you to do all these 20 things at a same time, it is totally okay for us to do things step by step  and a lot of steps are easy. Just remember about all these 20 things and bring them into your life. At your dinner table, talk to you parents about you English 23 topic next time. If you have to drive next time, find a friend who is also driving and you guys can carpool. When you are buying your food, buy the portion you need only. You will not only help the world, you are saving the money too. And you can not even believe how easy it is for all these great advantages.

<br><hr>
Thank you for writing down all the points, it made my life a whole lot easier. I decided to print these out and put them on my wall, kind of like a vision board, to remind myself that there are several small decisions I can make in my life that can change the world; a reminder that no matter how small an action is, it can still inspire and cause great change.
 <br><br>

I haven’t enjoyed or agreed with all of Ken’s lectures, but I strongly agree with everyone else that says this is the most important one. It summarizes effectively everything that needs to be done to bring change to the world. The most important point being to “be the change we want to see in the world”. It’s a great starting point to promote effective change, and it is the path to a healthier and happier life.

<br><hr>
I just want to start by thanking you for putting them in written form because that is going to make going back to study easier. Well, onto the video itself. I feel that Ken’s latest lecture video was a great final lecture because it really brought the whole course together into pretty much a mixtape. I feel that, even though the course is over, I will be able to come back later and still understand the basis of our climate crisis. I also feel that this is really the conclusion of the course because the main ideas of the last half of the quarter were reiterated and given their baseline definitions. Plus we can always use the other videos to gain specific information on the different topics we discussed. I also like how Ken literally said that this was a sort of study guide so kudos for him on that aspect as well.
<br><hr>
The things that Ken mentioned are things that are very easy to do and do not require much sacrifice or dramatic change to the way people currently leave.  Being that we have done so much to damage the planet, it seems like it is a given that we should at least follow these suggestions to reduce our greenhouse emissions.  
 <br><br>
Although doing things like changing our diet and using cars less seems like such a big change to our life for something that does basically nothing for the climate crisis, the fact is that if everyone in America does these changes, there will be an impact on the climate crisis.  Furthermore, the things suggested in this video are not particularly impactful on most people’s lives.  The most effective way to reduce your carbon footprint; eating with the climate in mind, just requires that you eat less meat.  Unfortunately, many people just refuse to make changes to their life with the planet in mind because they think that their efforts will do nothing because they are just one person, and that they have more important things to worry about than the climate crisis.
 <br><br>
I agree that educating yourself and other people about the climate crisis is a good way to increase action to reduce climate change.  Prior to taking this class, while I did know that it is bad to do things like waste electricity and excessively use cars, I did not really know how bad the planet’s condition was.  As people learn more about the climate crisis, they will realize how urgent the situation is and be more motivated to take action.
<br><hr>

I found it really interesting how you saw the connection between every thing in Ken's list with the two intrinsic goals from "Happy:" personal growth and community feeling.  It comes to show that being environmentally friend goes hand in hand with achieving a happier and more purposeful life just as Peter Kalmus has demonstrated and explained.  Not only does the climate crisis give us incentive to become more environmentally friendly, but merely just trying to achieve more fulfillment and purpose should be another incentive.  This also gives hope that since these things go hand in hand, the future may hold a better future when people realize how their lives can benefit from being environmentally friendly.  The Nordic countries are an example of such a future where they are ranked as the most happiest countries in the world, and these countries also give hope that it is more than possible to achieve what we need to do to solve the climate crisis.  Despite the fact that it is possible, it will still be tough convincing all the stubborn minds that are against change as there are still many who do not even believe in global warming.

<br><hr>
I agree with your idea that #17 is the most important solution in this list . In Ken's lecture, "Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet", I felt appreciative that there was a video that contained a concise list of all the things an individual can realistically do to prevent the onset of global climate change. #17 is something I personally need to do much more in my life. I am digesting all of the information provided in this course, but I am not really constantly reminding myself why this movement is important. It's pretty easy to slowly move on to the next thing in your life and not remember the importance of this movement-the importance that we all partake in it. Without #17 people won't have the motivation to do all of the other things in the list. I also thought that #18 was also important because knowledge needs to be shared in order to get more people into this movement.
<br><hr>
Thank you for providing a list of solutions, this made it a lot easier to follow along. But, yes I do agree that when people live their lives doing what they think is morally correct, they tend to be happier. This is because it gives them a sense of belonging in the world and they are doing something that they love. It also brings them closer together to people they love/ people like them and the solutions listed above lead to people living healthier lives.  I do agree that number 17 is the most important thing on the list because this is what will motivate to not go back to our old ways and make change continue to happen.

<br><hr>
I really like how you condensed the main points of the lectures into one comment. This lecture really summarized everything we have been learning about in this class, which is a lot of what we can do to lower our carbon footprint and live a greener and more fulfilling life. Your comment allowed me to see the points more clearly, as watching a lecture on it, it is harder to mentally remember each of the points. Your list made following the lecture much easier. Not only did you summarize the points of the lecture, but you also summarized many of the main themes from the movies we watched. I felt as if it really reflected what we’ve been learning this past quarter, which was one of the reasons why I really liked your comment. 
  <br><br>
I also believe that #17 was one of the most important reasons on the list. Many of these list points are straightforward actions that we need to change to help lower our carbon footprint. However, #17 addresses the mental change you need to make to really devote yourself to the climate crisis. Without the mindset, it would be impossible for anyone to make any of these changes. Not only that, I believe it is important to truly understand what kind of change you are trying to undertake before taking action. I believe it is fully necessary to understand the weight of your actions and what you can do before you do it. Thus, #17 was definitely one of the most important points in Ken’s lecture today.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with you about #17 being the most important. Being passionate about something is what drives us to take action. We protect the people and the things we love. I think it’s important to foster love for the Earth and the natural world because that’s what causes people to care about it in the first place and fight for environmental laws and changes. Ask any ES major and they will tell you that they love nature and the Earth. It’s interesting because not many people talk about environmental issues in terms of people caring. They assume that if people knew they would do something, but people have known about many of these issues and still have remained as bystanders and contributors to the destruction, so there must be some other disconnect. I think it’s a disconnect between our hearts and the Earth. In Kalmus’ video last week, he talked about how change starts one heart at a time. This week, in the movie “Happy” we are shown how people around the world deal with happiness, and those who seemed the most happy were in tune with their communities and the Earth. I think all of the changes Ken listed are extremely important to helping heal our Earth, but I think none of those changes will come to be unless people care.

<br><hr>
Thanks for the list, really helpful! I agree with your statement that #17 is perhaps the most important solution. When someone is passionate about a subject it gets them to get more involved. Like you said, it gets one motivated to create change. I feel that when someone is a passionate activist and inspiring it helps bring others in to join the cause. Being passionate makes others inspired and makes them believe that change is possible. I find this relatable in Peter Kalmus’ “Being the Change” as well as most of the other readings and films we’ve gone through over the course. When people are inspired and passionate about their subject, it allows people like me to become invested in these issues. Relating it to this week's readings and films, I found it inspiring how for instance Peter Kalmus talks about different ways we can reduce emissions, and he also mentions how much harm each causes. He has a great knowledge on the subject and uses his knowledge to inspire us to want to work together and create solutions for a better planet. Whereas in ”Happy” the way they presented how people focus too much on materialistic things and end up unhappy anyways, was awe-inspiring and got me to reflect on my own life.
<br><hr>
First of all, thanks for the very useful list. For me #20 is the most important because it has more dimensions that you actually think it has. Being the change you want to see isn't as easy as it sounds. People have a strong bias to exclude themselves from bearing responsibility that they desire others to do. Things like "oh but I only fly once every ..." people try to resolve the dissonance that is created by them not aligning with their actions. This is why I think it is very important to give them all the ammunition too easily make changes in their lives. People tend to go for the easiest ways around dissonance and usually this is not actually resolving the problem but thinking you way around it. This is why for so ling personal change has been difficult to affect by just telling people their options. You need to make it the absolute easiest way to change. Make it beneficial for them or at least convince them it will be in the long run, that is another think humans are notoriously bad at, calculation long term consequences and how to act accordingly. Oh and btw I love the song quote.
<br><hr>
Thank you for the written list and inspirational Miley Cyrus quote! I really enjoyed watching this video as it summarized most of the large topics we have gone over in this class. Having taken Eng. 22 my freshman year I am really glad I took this class this year. I not only learned a lot about what is going on in other countries and how the climate crisis is affecting them, I also learned many different ways to reduce my carbon footprint. I agree with you that the most important solution is #17. In order for someone to take action they must be firm believers that their actions will help their cause. I also believe that education is another big factor in initiating change. How do we expect people to embark on this journey of changing their way of living if they do not know what's going on? Educating people around the globe about what's going on will create conversation amongst one another that will then lead to change. Although not everyone has the privilege of attending school and learning about the climate crisis some people in other countries not learning about the climate crisis through YouTube videos, they are experiencing the catastrophic consequences of it.
<br><hr>
The list of things we can do as individuals is uplifting for a change, since we tend to view the climate crisis as an uphill battle. All of these measures are achievable changes we can implement, and would result in a happier, healthier, and more fulfilling society. Voting is one of the most important tasks we can do. On Super Tuesday, I cast my vote for Bernie Sanders because, among other reasons, he is the only candidate that is prioritizing the Green New Deal as one of his main platforms, and he is addressing the climate crisis with the severity and attention that it has needed for so long. Voting in local elections is just as important as voting in the primaries or the general presidential election, because change starts in the community. The biggest impact we can have is whether or not we allow a local politician who takes bribes from the fossil fuel industry to become district supervisor. If we can come together to prevent fossil fuel projects from happening in our communities and implement sustainable changes on a local level, we can build our way up more effectively to fight climate change on a national level. Activism and joining initiatives are other ways we can become actively involved in fighting the climate crisis. It is imperative that people are educated on the science of climate change and how individual and societal actions are harming the environment, and activism is one of the best ways to spread the message to communities around the world.
<br><hr>
First off, shout out to you for quoting the iconic Hannah Montana. I also think that #17 is a very important solution to the climate crisis. When it comes to climate activism (or activism in general), it's really important to be passionate about what you are doing. I know that when I first started climate activism I didn't have a clear purpose or reason for doing so, but after a lot of self-reflection I eventually came to realize I was so passionate about the issue because of how people in my community, including my own family, were being affected by the decisions of large corporations and our politicians. Sometimes climate activism feels a little bit hopeless, but it helps to remind myself of why it is that I choose to fight for climate action. I feel like just caring about something, in this case specifically about climate action, is the first step to doing something about. #17 on the list can lead a person to feel inspired to take other action, such as changing their diet and becoming a more educated voter.
<br><hr>
I fully agree and I think that we need more people that are passionate about the well being of our planet. Once people understand that money isn't everything, we may then be able to have conversations between the trade off from money and happiness/well being of people. This class has made me far more self aware of my priorities, one of which is financial stability and making money/advancing my career to a point where i can be making 200-300K during my life. I am constantly now reminding myself of how lucky i am to have what I do in my life and there is more that defines me than the amount of money I make. I hope to find a fulfilling passion that can make me happy as i enter the workforce.

<br><hr>
First of all, thank you for compiling all of that into a list for everyone. Second, yeah it just makes sense that intrinsic motivations are better and align with our morals. Bettering ourselves rather than our circumstances is much more productive in creating a better life for ourselves and for others. It creates a better culture which will not only make us happier people but greatly reduce our impact on the planet which we obviously, desperately need to do. Constantly reminding ourselves why this is important and that we need to actively be thinking about it is vital to accomplishing this.

<br><hr>
Thank you for writing out a list, that is very helpful. That being said,  the step that I personally view as being most valuable is eat a largely plant based diet. That is definitely the change I am aware causes some of the biggest amounts of carbon emissions in my everyday life. As I have commented, I do not drive a car so a majority of my personal emissions come from food and energy usage. I will say that having "vote" as one of these methods is a good way to motivate young students to get out to the polls. With the elections just happening, I know a bunch of people who didn't vote simply due to one reason or another. It is so important that our voice as the next generation is heard and it is somewhat disappointing seeing so many young voices not being utilized solely for the fact of not being properly motivated. Overall, I think all of these things are reasonable, small adjustments that can be made in anybody's everyday life and I will definitely try to implement them in mine.
<br><hr>
Thank you for the list! And I agree like so many of the people that have commented on your comment - that number 17 is the most important. You're right, if you truly want something then nothing can stand in your way. What a lot of people lack regarding the climate crisis is - incentive - and without that people tend not to act. I think having something you truly believe in and wanting it badly is an example of an incentive. So the question is, how exactly will we incentivize the American people to live more sustainably and compassionately? 
  <br><br>
Many of listed solutions are not even radical, in fact to me they even seem better than how we live now. We can literally live much more happy and fulfilling lives if we abandon our fossil fuels use and reevaluate our relationships with other people. 
  <br><br>
This weeks readings and films were very insightful and quite possibly then best on the syllabus. It's straightforward and comes to the point that we HAVE solutions, we're just not acting on them. This is a great way to end the course because it basically sums up everything that we have learned and offers solutions encompassing them. Number 17 is one of the most important on the list but so is number 20 - " become the change you want to see in the world" . We all have a responsibility to our selves, to others, to our environment, and to the planet. And its time that we realize it.

<br><hr>
thank you so much for writing out the list. While I agree with you about #17, I also thought #20 is very important, I believe that we must start with our own actions and reflect what we believe in through our actions. I've always thought that we have the power to influence people when we show our passion and commitment to things. Thus, as Gandhi said, "become the change you want to see in the world", is a great start. Overall, I think all these ideas are great in regards to assessing the climate crisis and contributing to the wellbeing  of our home/planet.
  <br><br>


I liked the way Ken addressed each of the solutions, and while some of them may seem out of our hands, I would say that most of these solutions are things that we can very easily do, such as joining or supporting initiatives and politicians that intend to mitigate the climate crisis. This class has taught me so much about the impact of my actions on the planet, but I love that while learning about all the things that are damaging the planet. It has also taught me the things I can change, do, and apply to my everyday life that will result in the reduction of my CO2 footprint. Hence, doing my part to ensure future generations won't suffer the consequences of the actions from past generations.
<br><hr>

I also think that the most important solution is 17. But I would also like to add to your list another solution that I think is also very important. We need to be responsible for each other and understand how our actions affect others. Because if we don't have that, a simple understanding between ourselves, we cannot achieve the goals we have set. The modern-day relationship of one person to another leaves much to be desired due to the constant competition created by the capitalist society, and a lot of other problems that are followed due to this. 
  <br><br>
Overall, I think it is very helpful to have a summary video like this. There have been a lot of movies we have watched in this class that talk about specifically one area that we can improve and bring positive changes into, but it can be hard sometimes to comprehend all of the points being made in the movies. In contrast, a video like this makes all the solutions clear, and most importantly, easy to remember, since there are not so many of them. It is a little surprising to me how these few changes can make such a big impact. 
  <br><br>
After this class, I realized how crucial it is for us to take care of our planet. So many catastrophic events are going on due to climate change right now, and there is so little attention paid to it. I made a promise to myself to do as much as I can to reduce, and hopefully eliminate, my emissions in the future to have a cleaner planet.
<br><hr>
First off Leanne, let me thank you for making a list of the 20 things we can do to save the planet. While watching Ken’s video I was often lost when we were on one thing or on to the next. So with that I thank you greatly!! :) 
  <br><br>

During Ken’s lecture I didn’t make the connection between these actions and intrinsic motivators but I’m glad you did and are sharing it. Now that you’ve pointed it out I can see that they all have to do with personal growth, community growth, or both. I think this is why people like Peter in the last film are happier living green lives. People who are more focused on the good of themselves and the good of the planet instead of materialistic things live a happier life. This is eye opening as it makes me question what I find important and how I can be a better and happier person. 
  <br><br>

I actually enjoy your quotes as I think it relates to week 8’s reading on how to communicate climate change. Making climate change more relatable and understandable is a great way to spread the word about climate change plus I think the audience will be more receptive. 
  <br><br>

The actions on the list that I find the most important are contraceptives, education,voting, and spreading the word about climate change. Education in general is important. With its positive externalities, educating people, especially women, will not only benefit them but benefit society as a whole. Education and contraceptives can go hand in hand in reducing the growth or population. I think one of the biggest factors contributing to climate change is the growing population. At some point the earth will reach its carrying capacity but hopefully it won’t come to that point. A reduction in population will reduce consumption and production of greenhouse gases. Voting on the other hand is a way to take action through legislation. It’s an easy task as well as a civic duty. Along with voting comes education. People need to be educated in order to vote and take action. This can be done by spreading the word and raising awareness among the masses.
<br><hr>
First of all thank you for writing that out for all of us to use as a reference. Overall this lecture video perfectly wraps up every important point addressed during the quarter. As important as these 20 items are, I think the main way to address the climate crisis is first and foremost addressing our values as a society, and re-evaluate what is important. As in this week's movie happy, we need to realize what are goals are at the end of the day, is it to own the newest iphone and fly on private jets or is it to be happy? We all need to re-evaluate our lives and implement a large number of the solutions on this list because many are very easy to do. For example, number 11 and 12 are voting, this is so important as this is how large scale changes will be accomplished, but individually it only takes us a few minutes to mail a ballot.

<br><hr>
Thank you very much for distilling and posting the list! Acknowledging the importance of #17, I like #20 as well. When the course reaches this point, all the possible solutions, personally or collectively, are included and fully informed. “Being the Change” is a nice real-life example for us all to follow. I don’t have so much to “say,” but I would like to act. Stay well-informed and updated, and at the same time start acting.
<br><hr>
Thank you for the list of solutions! It really helped to be able to visually read them over after watching the video. I think this video was really helpful in summarizing the key points made throughout the quarter for this class. Honestly, after seeing this list, it’s obvious that there are so many things that we can choose to fight against the crisis. Even if we don’t hit most of the things on this list, or even a quarter, just trying to reduce carbon emissions will create impact. If everyone does their part, this impact will build up. However, if everyone ignores the issue and takes an all or nothing mentality, the Earth will deteriorate even faster. After all, just because you can’t do every single thing on the list, doesn’t mean you should give up and give up any personal responsibility. I hope everyone in this class does their part in reducing their carbon footprint and improving our planet.
<br><hr>
I think that solutions 11 through 14 are the most important for the fight against climate change. I can't stress this enough-voting is such a big deal. Through legislation we would have a stewardship of our natural resources. To become an informed voter, one must have a solid eduction. So solutions relating to education that Ken described in the video are also very important. The other solutions are what we've been talking about throughout the course of this class. Flying less, driving cars less, buying less, and eating cleaner are some of the multitude of ways we as a people could do to lessen our carbon footprint. Limiting food waste should be a no-brainer, but, sadly, it is not. We waste so much food every day through huge portions and buffets. This was a good way to close out this course. An optimistic, but steadfast send-off from Ken is something that will inspire a lot of people in this class, including myself, to live more eco-conscious lives.

<br><hr>
I agree that the most important solution is #17 as well because it encapsulates the rest. If you want to abide by 17, you kinda don't have a choice but being conscious about how your decisions affect the environment. The climate crisis cannot be solved without deep passion fighting for this cause because it is crucial to save our planet and our species. It is really hard to revitalize your passion for the cause however because so many times, it just seems to bleak. There's so many forces opposing saving the earth, such as those who deny climate change is a thing, big politicians who preach that climate change isn't important or real, and big money people and industries who benefit financially from things that are detrimental to our planet. Put all these together with our own basic stubbornness to do away with much of the elements of our own daily life, it's not entirely much to give one hope that this issue can be solved. It's a downer, no doubt. But if you can't overcome this outlook, things will only get worse. You gotta hope for the chance of success. Success isn't just handed to you, especially success in something as big as this.
<br><hr>
I love you and your comment so much Leanne! It is so good to look at problems we face with passion and optimism, the desire to see the change we have become in the world, like 20.  Otherwise, we will not advance as a society or as self-aware individuals!
<br><hr>
I think you really nailed it in narrowing down the most important solution to be number 17. Change begins with passion, and without passion you can't really be truly dedicated to your cause. I agree with you that it is important to reflect on why the cause is so important to you because it helps revitalize your passion and provides you with more motivation. Besides number 17, I also think that voting in politicians who will enact climate change legislation is another very important solution. Passionate people don't really have the power to make a significant change; the politicians in power do. Therefore we need to channel our passion for saving the planet and make our voices heard to the government in order to really make a difference.
<br><hr>
Thanks for writing out all the points. I really like this video among all the lecture videos, because it is very concise and clear. Ten bullet points for personal actions and ten bullets points for political actions sum up what we want to see and need to do for changes. We need to be the change and so does the government. I was kind of surprised that I did not intended to remember all these points throughout the quarter, but after reading so many articles and watching so many videos and films, these ideas are already familiar to me. Now I see the influence that this course is having on me. I start to tell my roommates about the bad leftover does to the environment and I begin to carpool with my roommates. And I did all these just unconsciously. I really appreciate what Ken has taught us throughout the quarter. Even though those are just some small changes, but I believe in Butterfly Effect.
<br><hr>
I absolutely love this comment, makes sense why it has 49 comments, soon to be 50. Not only does it give a written list to aid in talking points for comments, but you mention the other readings/films which ties into the entirety of this course and all these other applications. I never expected anyone to reference a Hannah Montana quote in the middle of a climate change assignment, but I'm glad you did. This is bigger than us, we need to look beyond ourselves to make the change, just as number 20 professes. I hope that one day we'll be able to say we did it. I know my biggest fear is death without having accomplished anything in life, and if saving the planet is something to be proud of, I damn hope we do it.
<br><hr>
This was a great comment! I liked how you brought in the other sources from this week, as I was similarly thinking about how each action on the list incorporated at least one of the two intrinsic goals in "Happy." And, of course, the iconic references were fantastic. However, I do have to disagree with you on the most important solution we can take in this fight. While maintaining and revitalizing our passion for the cause and for our environment is quintessential in being an activist for climate, for the average person, this isn't going to be as effective as voting, I believe. As a citizen of the United States, the country emitting the second largest amount of greenhouse gasses, I feel like I have the most power in fighting the climate crisis through my ballot. In our representative democracy, we have the capability to elect people, who will fight for the planet, into positions of power. So while, yes, it is imperative that as an activist you must keep your passion for the cause alive and well, this action may not be as significant, on a global scale, as utilizing our ability here in America to speak with through votes.

<br><hr>
Like many others have said, thank you for the list. From my experience, the second half of of the list is the most difficult one to do, especially 13. Making the choice to go vegan might be hard, but at least it's a choice that I've brought unto myself and it is me that will have to deal with that choice. Convincing others, who have already set their life in motion and have their own decisions made, is really hard. I'm currently trying to convince the people close to me to be more conscientious of their choices and it is extremely frustrating when you're dismissed and told that they choose to live their lives as they please because it is their lives, when they don't realize that those choices affect everyone in the world and not just themselves. It's actually very disheartening. Nonetheless, the issue is too important to stop, and this subject is one that I care about so I will continue to advocate for the environment, even when it feels like you're fighting a lost cause.
<br><hr>
Thank you for your list. Among those solutions, I find the 20th solution, “become the change you want to see in the world" to be very insightful. Sometimes people say good stuff but fail to take action. We learned how to make an impact on climate change and there are ways to help in our daily life. But what we need most is to really do something. Easier said than done. When it comes to actually do something, there are just so many things might make us stop. Family, friends, work, and social life etc. It is difficult to make a lifestyle change to fit into this environmental friendly life. It must take a lot of gut to actually change. Although I know beef is bad for the environment, I would probably not give up eating it because it tastes good. Although driving is the major contributor to greenhouse gas, I would probably still buy a car in the future because it makes life more convenient. But I will feel somewhat guilty when I do these things. I do not want to be the guy who destroys the earth for his own pleasure.
<br><hr>
I know it's the same thing everyone else is saying, but I really did feel like this video tied the course together well. I have spent the whole course recommending pieces of content to friends and family, but I can only imagine that will continue once it is over - my world is shook. Growing up, the mere existence of climate change was doubted heavily in my community. In high school and college, I learned basic and troubling facts about the crisis. It was only till this class that I felt ready to take action.

  <br><br>

Seeing the list above, I wanted to write my own corresponding list, of the ways I've responded this quarter.

  <br><br>

1. Switched from a meat-heavy diet including beef, lamb, and pork, into a much less meat heavy "avi-pescatarian" diet that prioritizes much more climate-friendly options than I had been consuming.

  <br><br>

2. Stopped consuming particularly climate damaging foods, like bananas, and eliminated entirely unnecessary food waste, by always eating everything I order or make, and saving the extras.
  <br><br>


3. Used contraception!

  <br><br>

5. Found substitutes for driving locally, like buses, clever biking situations, and just wearing through my shoes.

  <br><br>

7. Planned a local honeymoon instead of an international trip.

  <br><br>

8. Only bought four necessary new clothing items, and recycled unusable items an clothes locally when possible.

  <br><br>

11. Voted!

  <br><br>

12. Signed local petitions advocating for climate reform.
  <br><br>


13. Told most of my friends and family about this course, and the impact it was having on me.
  <br><br>


15. Protested fracking with a protest poem and an oil spill demonstration.
  <br><br>


17. Spent time learning and reflecting about the importance of climate justice.
  <br><br>


20. Made my first big steps towards being the climate change I want to see in the world!

  <br><br>

Thanks Ken!
<br><hr>

Thank you for listing the 20 solutions. I have been doing some of them, like using public transport or bike instead of private car and telling people about the climate crisis. I would love to vote for candidates that advocates eco-friendly policies, but I am an international student. I agree with your opinion that maintaining the passion is the most important. Back to the film and the reading material, people that are able to keep doing things that protect our environment never lose the motive and passion for the green lifestyle. 
  <br><br>
In addition to habit that common people can keep doing every day, we should also pay attention on social problems. For example, I remembered that equally educating girls and boys ranked the fourth in the list of top twenty. Most of the fastest developing countries have a relatively low gender inequality index, like east Asia and north Europe. Moreover, as Ken mentioned in the last lecture, the technique of communicating is also crucial, and the climate crisis is more like a social problem than a scientific problem.

<br><hr>

I like how you clearly wrote out all the 20 things one can do for the environment because it kind of plays off something stated in the video how everything has to be put in perspective. I believe one issue that is holding back the climate movement is that people do not know just how bad some of the things they do is for the environment. For this reason I believe that more information such as this video which states exactly how much greenhouse gases is being emitted by what and how much emissions would be cut when doing a specific action needs to be produced and organized in a way to easily communicate that message to the public. Another misconception that bothers me is how the Earth has changed temperatures so much in the past so it is natural, yes they are right in the sense that the Earth will be fine, it is just that life as we know it as humans and animals will end and we probably will not survive. We are finally a generation that can no longer blame lack of information for not doing anything about the climate crisis and with these steps and more we will be able to save the environment and us along with it.

<br><hr>
Thank you so much for the list! this week's video is a great review of what we have learned throughout the course. Thanks for the efforts for listing out all of them with explanations. And yes I agree that this week's video will be the best video for me to share with my friends. Great summary, advises on how we should act to make a difference, easy to access and approachable.
<br><hr>
Yes! You synthesized this information perfectly! I agree that #17 is the most important item on the list. If we don't start from a place of passion then our efforts will eventually falter. I can personally attest to the statement that the intrinsic goals of personal growth and sense of community are true sources of happiness. I have been doing an internship with Food & Water Action, an environmental non-profit that mobilizes regular people to build up their political power to fight for clean water, good health and a livable climate. I have never felt a greater force of passion, connection and meaning than through my work within this organization. It has pushed me to grow as an individual in so many ways. It has enabled me to foster a sense of community and really feel like I am a part of something bigger. I feel like I have truly started to understand what is really important in life and these two intrinsic motivations push me to fight for it.

<br><hr>
Gonna start with the quote because I think it fits perfectly. Passion and heart can make it possible to conquer any obstacle that one may encounter in their lifetime. I agree that #17 is one of the best solutions to the climate crisis. It is the same thing as to why many people stop smoking cigarettes. They decide it is important for them to stop for either their health or so they can live to see their kids grow up and see their grandchildren. Passion in activism can spark change never thought possible. With educated and passionate people, I firmly believe that we as humans can put a stop to the climate crisis and put an end to the catastrophic and negative effects.

<br><hr>
Thank you for listing all the twenty things. I find that most of the twenty things are easy to finish, such as eating plant-based meals and choosing environmental-friendly products. But there is one thing that I find it is really hard to accomplish. It is choosing slow transportation instead of plane. It is so hard to change this way. Because now time is the most important treasure for everyone, it is really inconvenient to choose the slow transportation. Besides these requirements that needs uss to take action, You are right, it is true if we want to keep our enthusiasm to protect the environment #17 is important. This is the main and core for long-term environment protection. If we want to insist our standpoint for a long time, we do have to figure out the reason that this thing is important for us. So I do agree with you that #17 is really important.
<br><hr>
I agree with everything you said on a very personal level. All of the above 20 solutions are viable and can help combat the issue of climate change. The first 10 being on a personal level are important because if you do not make the changes to help save our world what makes you think that others will? It begins with sacrifice, but, as you state very clearly, passion is what motivates us to be willing to sacrifice something for a larger cause. Change will only happen if we force change, but to do that we need to understand why we are forcing change. It is important that this understanding happens on a personal level first. If you want to inspire others than you first need to inspire yourself. The best leaders are the ones who have genuine passion, because people will be able to tell if that passion is genuine or not, and if they can see through an illusion of passion then they will lose motivation. The best leaders are the ones who can inspire passion in others. One thing I can liken it to is teachers. If you've ever had a bad teacher for a subject you thought you would be interested only to see yourself lose that passion for that particular subject over the course, then you will understand what I'm talking about. On the other hand of that comparison, is the teacher that inspires you to explore further and reinvigorates that passion because they are passing their passion onto you. I agree with you about the importance of action #17 because if we ourselves are passionate about this issue, then ideally we can pass off that passion to others and together we can create real change.

In this lecture, the professor gives us a general summary about what we’ve learned this quarter, it’s about how to save our environment. It really gives us a specific idea about how to do it and how to do it better. All those things the professor says in the video are practical and worth knowing. Among all twenty things, I believe that #1 and #2 are the solution that apply to me the most. Of course, I know that from the lecture that compares to transportation and other stuff, changing one’s diet can be the less effective thing to do to make our planet better off, however, it can be the most appliable method that I can do. Personally, I kept using e-bikes as a major transportation back in home, but compares to using cars as a major transportation, bike is not an efficient way to travel around in a big city where has many high roads. Also, for an international student, it is inevitable to choose plane as a major transportation to travel around between countries. So, it may be the best for me to start making a difference by changing my personal diet. I believe small changes still count, and they will eventually accumulate and make a huge impact.
<br><hr>

exactly! Genuine effort comes from a genuine desire! My grandpa always asks me "why did the village idiot become the mayor? because he had the desire!" It doesn't matter who you are, where you live, how old you are, or how educated you are, if you want to make a change, you have the power to do it! Your internship seems really interesting, and your story adds to the idea that human connection (with others and even with yourself) is the ultimate source of happiness.

<br><hr>

I agree with you! Small changes do count! I personally find it hard to eliminate animal products from my diet, but I acknowledge that if I did in fact switch to a vegan diet, I would be making a difference. Meanwhile, I hear many people say that they would never become vegan and that "one person isn't going to make a difference". Well you can't get to a million without one! That negative mindset is probably more detrimental than not going vegan, because if those people truly believe that one person can't make a difference, they must not believe in any personal action whatsoever!
<br><hr>
I think you make a good point! Voting is very important! Rules govern our lives and affect how much of a change we can actually make, and the only way we can change the rules is through voting.
<br><hr>
So awesome! Great job
<br><hr>
I totally agree that solution #17 is necessary and probably the most important among this list because that's what is really at the root of all our motivation. We need to remember why we have to make these changes in order to be motivated to take action. At the root of it all, we want to be happy and we can't be happy knowing that we're destroying our planet. I truly believe that a minimalistic lifestyle will bring happiness to most people because we don't need all the material things to find joy. I like how you added the Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana quotes because it just made your comment more fun to read and allowed me to connect my childhood to something happening right now. Ever since we were kids, these are the kinds of values that have been taught to us and I know that we just need a little push to get to where we want to be but it's just hard.
<br><hr>
 I agree with you! Selfishness and ignorance are our two biggest threats, and happiness is our savior. I always think "why do we want to solve the climate crisis?" The most obvious reasons are because people are dying, animals are dying, and the earth is becoming uninhabitable. We see these things as problems. However, WHY exactly do we see these things as problems? Bad things happen in life, death is a part of life, and in the end, we all die anyway! The earth is no exception -- the earth will die one day. So why is climate change a crisis? Well, it's a crisis because of happiness. Happiness is what we live for, and we want to be happy for as long as life lasts. How can we be happy if we know that our children or our grandchildren will live horrible lives? This is why climate change is a crisis. We are ruining the very land that nourishes our bodies and provides us with happiness.
<br><hr>
If, every day, every person in the world decided to try and to just implement as many of these as they could, the world would be such a better place. The reality of it is, there are 7 or 8 of these suggestions that take little or no effort, and there really is no excuse to not implementing these simplest solutions. As a stem major, before this class I would have likely expected technological solutions to dominate the top of this list, but every single suggestion is a humanitarian one. Voting, which is two of the twenty solutions, takes less than an hour a year. Reading and educating yourself on the topic can be done at nearly any point when you have free time, as it can scale with the amount of time you have, and any amount of education you receive on the subject is an improvement of the status quo. Using that knowledge gained to talk to people about the climate and sharing and implementing solutions also go hand in hand, and are easy to implement. Being the change you wish to see in the world is something we see Ken do every lecture, as he practices all of these policies that he speaks so highly of.  Finally, practicing some form of minimalism, just buying less and wasting less food is again, an easy practice that saves you money. There is so much every person can do to mitigate the detriment of the climate crisis, and you do not have to be in the top 1% economically to do so. Any person can contribute without over-exerting themselves and placing too much financial strain on themselves, and so there is really little excuse to not participating in the most important fight in the history of humanity: the fight for our planet's survival.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with your attitude toward this video. After taking this class, I found out how important and severe the climate crisis is and now it is time for us to make some effort and help our society to improve.
<br><hr>
I appreciate you for making the list down which is personally a bit hard to follow during the video. And the connection you made between this lecture video and the film is great! #17 is important as it reminds us we should always think about where we've come from and where we are going. Our passion has led us all the way through and we should adjust it to guide us in the future.
  <br><br>
Environmental crisis is a issue that each individual should take it seriously, because it's not only about our lives, but the countless generations after us, the sustainability of the earth we are living on. The only way to make actual changes is to first admit that the problem exists.
  <br><br>
Even though we are facing a serious and stressful situation right now, we still have time to save all these things. All the 20 things listed in the list are the starting points for us to save the earth. If we care enough about out planet, we will have the courage and the insistence to bring real changes and influence people around us to step into the situation together.

<br><hr>

 I thought this was an excellent rap of the entire quarter, Ken did such a wonderful job.I love that you listed all of the 20 things.  I also really want to watch this with my whole family as they are very concerned about climate change and want to align their actions with their values just don’t know exactly how to do that and this video lays out an amazing blueprint for it. First of all, while I was shocked that there are 85 million unintended pregnancies in teh world, I was more shocked that 45% of pregnancies in the US (with great access to contraception, abortion, etc) are unintended! I know there is a strong correlation between education for women and lower birth rates, but this could lower emissions by 103 gigatons! This is second only to food waste and changing our diet!
   <br><br>
I liked number 10 that you listed which is only purchasing from companies with socially and environmentally just practices should be something we need to adopt. THis is key because although it takes some inconvenience, if we can align our beliefs with our actions people are a lot more likely to be inspired by us to do the same and then hopefully teach others. Second, it will help these companies compete in a marketplace that is dominated by cheap but exploitative labor that leads to environmental degradation and social injustice in the first place. We can see the environmental and social impact of cheap consumerism in the True Cost very clearly. 
  <br><br>
 Lastly, I really like the spin off of Naomi Klein’s first book on the climate crisis, This Changes Everything. Ken said it could easily be turned into an imperative: if we are going to successfully survive this, “we need to change everything.” I totally agree. This is what defines and separates this class from every other climate change class: it is not focused on science based solutions but our culture and the norms and practices associated with it that lead to the climate crisis, and how we can change personally and on a collective/political level the cultural norms. This is why I am such a big fan of Bernie. My older brother said something to me that reminded me of this point of “we need to change everything” that Ken made referencing the elections. He said if you think Trump is the root cause of American’s problems and things were great before him, you vote for Biden. But if you think Trump is just a symptom in a corrupt system you vote for Bernie. Bernie is right. Ken is right. For the climate crisis. For a more equal world that works for the poor and middle class not just billionaires and millionaires and corporations. For a world that is safe and stable.We need a revolution. We need to rethink how we view freedom, we need to reconsider many American cultural norms, we need to stop being obsessed with an unsustainable economic growth system, and we need to prioritize the environment and human lives. In other words, “we need to change everything”
<br><hr>
I really like the list, and your explanation behind the the solution of #17. Personally, I think #13 is the most important. Spreading awareness of this problem and seeing it is key. In my opinion America is too oblivious to this problem. It's not out of arrogance, but rather this problem is just not taken seriously enough by the majority of people who contribute to the problem heavily. Informing people and spreading the word about the climate crisis is a must. Without recognizing the problem we cannot solve the problem.
<br><hr>
I absolutely loved this response. Thank you for laying out the list. I wrote down my own throughout Ken’s video, but it was nice to read over it again, especially with the way you worded the items on it. The list gave a great overview of the class and what we’ve learned, but I really appreciated how you went even further and painted an even more meaningful picture of the class. You are so right that personal happiness and saving the planet go hand in hand. Items on the list not only work to solve the climate crisis, but they will increase our personal well-being and most of the films and readings from this class support that fact. A plentitude of facts are drilled in my head after this class. Information is extremely important if we are going to take action and encourage it in others, but it is hard to not be selfish in this world. We all have busy lives, obligations and responsibilities, so it can be hard to rearrange our schedules even if it’s to help save the planet. But the items on this list should be appealing to even the most selfish people; there is so much personal gain that can come from doing some of things on this list. Like you said: personal growth and community feeling. Giving back to the environment can feel so rewarding because you are aligning your actions with your values. More specifically, minimalism can strip away unnecessary materialistic things in your life and bring more connectivity to others and the planet. Living in co-housing, like the woman described in “Happy,” allows for a stronger sense of community and a distribution of work. Riding your bike or other examples of slow travel have many physical and mental benefits. Saving our planet is good for the soul!
<br><hr>
Before anything, THANK YOU for your written list! It really did a big favor for many of us. I completely agree with you when you said that we are capable of achieving anything we want and personally, I think #17 would be the one most important solution too. 

  <br><br>

As of today, many people are unwilling to consider the true and disparate impact climate change can bring to us and to the environment, and I believe they could be put into two main groups: large corporations and companies, and those who are misled and not getting the right information on the topic. Example of the first group of people can be seen in the film we watched on week 3, “Merchants Of Doubt”, oil companies like Exxon are especially accounted for. They continue to twist facts and data of climate change and attack scientists, the main thing which drives them is one thing very similar to passion but completely opposite, greed. While passion drove scientists and climate change activists into doing acts like researching, promoting change, protesting, which help us see the truth and encourage people to make the right decision, greed drove the companies into making decisions which allows them to earn the most profit without considering anything else. As of the second group, those who are being misled, #18 on Ken’s list would be the best way to lead them back on track, which is “use knowledge to share and implement solutions”, this will allow them to get a chance to understand what climate change is truly about, and how action is required immediately to protect the environment and prevent future disasters.
<br><hr>

I agree I found very interesting the idea of intrinsic and extrinsic goals/ motivations from the film and how extrinsic goals which were more materialsitic proved to lead to less happiness than that of internally focused goals like personal growth. If society promoted intrinsic goals more and less goals which revolves around the concept of materials equalling happiness, perhaps more people would happy and we would produce less waste which would benefit our planet.

<br><hr>
This list is very helpful, so thank you so much for summarizing everything Ken listed. I also believe that number 17, because you are right, if you truly want to see change then do something, don’t try and do it just actually do it. I also believe that voting is also another very important solution, in seeing change because the candidates that we vote for have the real power to make change, because yes we the people can go protest and gather together to call for a change the people in office are the ones who are able to create and pass laws and acts that give us what we want. Same goes for 20, as Ken said talk is cheap, and overall actions speak louder than words.
<br><hr>
First of all, thank you for making the list of all twenty things. Even after watching the video, there are always a few that will slip your mind. Second, I really enjoy the connection you specifically made to the film "Happy." To me, your connection highlighted that fighting for climate activism doesn't have to be all that bad. Like you said, each of the items on the list provide either personal growth or a community feeling, thus sparking feelings of happiness. It's so opposite to what most people say. People often think that changing into a climate-conscious person involves giving up too much and becoming involved in too many things. They tend to just shrug it off for other people to do. What they don't take into account is how these actions could ultimately make them into a better and happier person. 
  <br><br>

I also would have to agree with you about #17 being the most important one of all. For me and probably a lot of other people, the climate crisis often will fall to the back of my mind when other, more stressful issues come to mind. Don't get me wrong, the climate crisis is definitely stressful, but oftentimes midterms and finals encapsulate my mind way more. However, as long as we are reminding ourselves why the climate crisis is so important to us, then we can continue to make decisions and actions that are climate-conscious.

<br><hr>

Thanks a ton for this list of all the things we can do! I agree with your perspective that solution #17 is the most important of the bunch, and arguably the most difficult to obtain and retain. In my opinion, the greatest challenge with combating the climate crisis truly is motivating the masses and encouraging them to become passionate about the issue. As our society is pretty much entirely consumed with consumerism, it will continue to be a challenge pushing the climate crisis issue to the top of the list for Americans as we are already preoccupied with so many other problems. However, change can only happen if the issue persists at the forefront of discussion, the more people hear and develop an understanding of the climate crisis, the more likely they will be to become motivated and activists themselves. I also would like to highlight your closing statement about how it is so important for us to personally reflect and remind ourselves why the issue is of importance to us, as it is the only way to keep pushing the movement forward. Ultimately, the more we look at and are reminded about the lists of solutions of how we can actively and individually combat the climate crisis, the more likely we are to adopt these habits ourselves, in turn, encouraging those around us to do the same.
<br><hr>
Beyond thankful that there are students like yourself in this class that take the time and devotion to make things such as lists that will benefit others in the class, such as myself. I chose to respond to your comment because the passion you showed in why you believe that solution #17 is the most important and I honestly do not disagree. I think that if there is going to be any real and significant change to the climate crisis this is by far the solution that we need to be pushing for, especially here in the United States. The fact that so many people have heard about the climate crisis or have even become educated on the subject, but then that they chose to do nothing with the information that they have gained is astounding and disturbing. You think that people would want to spread this information and hep find even more ways to discover solutions to the inevitable problems that we are going to face. We need people all over the world to maintain and revitalize the passion for the cause now more than ever. We are coming up to a point in our lives with the upcoming presidential elections that we now have a way to actually improve our circumstances. We need to remember what this crisis means to everyone around the world and we need to start taking action, yes all of this solutions are things that we should strive to employ. We now need to realize that these are steps we need to take and I hope that everyone who sees your original comment or the proceeding comments will gain some sense of urgency and that they begin to take action.
<br><hr>
Thanks for summarizing the list for us, as it was difficult to keep a mental list of it all as I was watching the video. Personally I believe the most important solutions are #17 as you said and #18. I agree that if you truly want something you can make it happen, but If you lose passion in your convictions then its less likely that you will take action. I felt lost in my own convictions through out this years, and with everything going on right now its hard to stay focused on them in trying times. Your comment has made me want to regain focus on what I'm fighting for even through the hard times that we are all sharing right now. I liked the reference to Miley Cyrus that you made, and it's definitely uplifting to hear a quote made in reference to her. Hope and Passion are the two strongest factors that keep people motivated to get things done, and like Brandon said, I believe they come before fear. We can use fear to push people to action, but it wouldn't be as effective or moral as hope and passion. I think using our knowledge to share and implement solutions is also important, #18, because if done the correct way we can motivate people who might not have been in line to take action on climate change if we hadn't communicated the importance of it all. Overall I loved your comment, thanks for sharing your stance.

<br><hr>
I really enjoyed this video. It really shows how simple everyday things can go a long way. That really is the best way to make a major change in the world. With little things that we can all do it will show how much of a collective difference can make and make want people to want to think more about what they can do too. 
  <br><br>
I also really enjoyed this comment. The list of solutions is in-depth and amazing. It really shows how things you do every day without thinking about it or things you could easily enough do could make a huge difference. Such simple things such as really considering who are voting for and what they want to do or not do about the climate crisis can do about it.

<br><hr>
I like that we have learned about everything on the list and that there are places where we can learn more about each individual solution in this class. It's nice to end a class on the climate change crisis on a note of hope, there are things that we can do personally and together that makes a difference in the fight against climate change. I agree, it's important to believe in something before doing it. When we are sincere and passionate about the subject, it really shows in our actions and has more of a impact on those around us seeing us act upon what we have learned. We cannot just have taken this class and make no changes to our lives that doesn't help the environment. We can't just learn about these things and then not act upon them.
<br><hr>
I think that this list is incredibly helpful and can really impact the future. These are the necessary steps to save the world and each and every person must do this to save everyone. The pursuit of happiness is what will drive our species to extinction, however I believe that to give up ones own goals and aspiration is one of the most difficult things to do. We were taught to do our best and be rich and wealthy and have everything which will lead to everlasting happiness. To be "successful" is what will led to a fulfilling life, however many rich people tell us that it isn't leds to happiness. Yes a lack of resources will lead to depression, but having an abundance does not mean that you will be happy. I agree that Being the Change is what leds to true happiness. not just to help the world but to really understand what will led to happiness and why we are doing what we do and really analyzing this factor. I believe that our goals are blinded by what is expected of us and that will led to our destruction as a species. Life will go on even if we destroy it and perhaps another intelliget life form will take our place, however I believe that We have the power to prevent our destruction.

<br><hr>
I really liked how this lecture tied a lot of what we’ve been discussing in class together. I definitely think access to contraceptives and education for women are the most important issues on this list. They are not just concerning the climate crisis, they are about basic human rights and equality. I think these issues are also the ones that need to be addressed first. Maybe some of the women we educate can help come up with climate solutions. Gender equality is such a huge and important issue, it goes way beyond the climate. All of the other aspects are important as well, many of them can be grouped together as ‘making climate conscious choices’. This means eating, travelling, dressing, and living for the climate. However, with the inequality we face in the world today these are not solutions for everyone. Until gender and wealth (and all) inequality are addressed at a global level, we have no chance at combating the climate crisis and saving ourselves. I believe places like the United States have the power to influence other countries to support these causes and pass legislation supporting women and girls. We just need politicians and leaders that care about these issues and are willing to push for them. We also need people to stand up and speak out for change. We can make a difference by changing our diets and our habits, but we can also speak out for other people and show our support for these women and girls.


<br><hr>
I love that you took the time to write down the list because now I can keep it as a note in my phone! Also like all the other replies, I love that you quoted Miley Cyrus!! t's nice to have a constant reminder of little actions I can do to aid climate activism. I definitely will be referring to this list often and will share it with my family and friends because all these solutions are extremely doable! This list of solutions will be an amazing resource for me and one of the many takeaways from this class. I agree with you that #17 is very important because it is so easy to get caught up and forget. For me personally, this happens a lot and I think reminding myself of the importance of my personal actions will keep me in check.

<br><hr>
My favorite one is believe everyone should try to do more is to educate yourself. People need to learn what they can do to lower their carbon footprint and help save the planet. The media will not tell you what you can or will only tell you the most basic things you can do that hardly help. Also electing someone is a huge one as well. Of course we can all do our own things that help but greater change comes from the politicians we elect and their plan to help better the world. the last thing I would want to add is the passion you have to be the change. Passion is one the biggest motivators all of us have. If we all collectively want to see change and have the passion for it, we will truly get it. Although I talk about these 3 things, everything on this list is are all important as well in order to change the world.
<br><hr>
Thank you for laying out the things he said in the video so fluently. It makes it very easy to see what I can do, and what I can start doing right now. I enjoy your stress on #17 as well. You can't keep a fire going if you don't keep throwing wood on it. If you lose sight of what you're fighting for, or if you lose interest in the issue at hand, your cause is essentially null. For example, if the T.A.'s started to lose interest, say "eh, it's not that bad. Let's just go back to work", or just lost interest and got caught up with the other pressures of life, the strike would die along with the dreams entailed in it. I agree, #17 is of upmost importance.

<br><hr>
I definitely agree with you. I don’t think we could make a change without our passion for our cause. If you do not want to do something you don’t think you have to do, why would you do it? That sounds a bit stupid but it’s why people don’t do a lot of things. In order to make a difference in this case, we need to be passionate about fighting the climate crisis. Being passionate is the reason we do any of the 19 other solutions. It is why we go out of our way to try to save the world when such a large number of people does not care. I think that this also improves the quality of life and leads us to live happier since we are fighting for a cause that helps everyone. Ken gives a good summary of everything that we’ve gone over that helps us battle the climate crisis. He explains the most important and possible things to do under the personal, climate, and political action categories. This definitely is the most important video to show to others outside of this class, since it sums up everything that a person needs to know to do something about the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
Having all the twenty steps written down makes it so much easier to remember. I think that this quarter has made me realize how much I could be doing through personal actions that would affect climate change. These actions could ultimately result in a happier and more rewarding life.
<br><hr>
Thank you for making this list! Seeing all of them in writing makes it so much easier to see just how easy it is to implement these things into our every day life. The only thing that prevents most people from doing these things are greed and misinformation, which can be fixed by... doing the things on this list. It seems a bit like a "Catch 22" situation, but the only way we can even hope to appeal to the dismissive contributors of climate change is to educate them on why what they're doing is wrong. If that doesn't work, we need to make it illegal for people to harm to planet, which can be solved by number 12 on the list. 
  <br><br>


Something I think would be interesting to see is a list specified for wealthy people, dictating the ways they can use their resources to help fight this issue. Things like number 13 could be something like, "use your social media and wide reach to educate people about the climate crisis and possible solutions". Anyone with a vast amount of wealth is uniquely positioned to use their status to spread the most information and donate the most money without pausing their day to day life. A lot of people feel they cant do the things listed above because they're too busy working and trying to make a living wage, among all the other social responsibilities like parenting and mental health. Celebrities and the rich have much more time and much less to lose by making themselves full time advocates for climate change. The rest of us cannot afford to devote nearly as much time because we are stuck in a system that doesn't leave us an opportunity to do so.
<br><hr>
Thank you for the list! It's super helpful. I also agree that your solution #17 is probably the most important. I think the main reason people have not acted on climate change is that they do not believe that they need to. They do not see how it will affect them, so it is not very important to them. Unfortunately, many people find it hard to care about things that they cannot see happening, or that does not directly affect them, myself included. I do care deeply about the subject of the climate crisis, but for some other issues, I find it difficult to be passionate because I do not see the effects on a regular basis. It's kind of an out of sight, out of mind sort of thing. I do acknowledge that I need to work on this, obviously an issue for anyone should be an issue for everyone, but at the same time, ignorance can feel like bliss. I think that is why we need to make people aware of the fact that the climate crisis will affect them eventually, one way or another. I believe that #17 and #13 on your list together is what will get people to take part in all of the other solutions as well.


<br><hr>
I actually agree to disagree you with this issue. I recognized the years of gender inequality that is perpetuated everywhere, it is worse in some and still existent in a lot of powerhouse countries that have claimed to be against this inequality. However, there are a lot of underlying issue with the inequalities in our educational system. Different beliefs and cultures that are perpetuated in different parts of the world play a huge role in this issues. If we try to prioritize this issue as a solution to an even worse issue, we might be losing more time fighting for another issue that has been fought for for years. I'm not saying that educating women equally should not be emphasized, that should be a given thing already. But, that conversation has already been said and a new narrative needs to be put on a spotlight. 
  <br><br>
Our generation is rampantly dictated by the fast paced always changing and trending social media. We need to put away in which we can create a focus on these issue in those platforms. I think that's the most important solution: spreading awareness. Through education also but most importantly through the very screens that we look at everyday.
<br><hr>
I really enjoy reading your list summarizing Ken’s video, which provides us a clear and concise version of the video. I believe that this list can definitely be referenced by anybody caring the environment, which can provide them a reliable guideline for personal, collective, and political actions. Moreover, I also believe that #17 is very important, because our thoughts determine our actions, and actions lead to changes in the world, so thinking is definitely one crucial step to real changes. I also really like how you reference lyrics in two encouraging songs, because music for me is one of the most powerful tools for adjusting my mood and mind, so I echo strongly with the spirits in those lyrics. 
   <br><br>

Seeing this video and this list, I feel like I have been going through our class once again on fast-forward, which brought me to reflect on the various things we can do about the environment we learnt in the class. I think Ken surely addresses the goal of helping us to see climate change from a cultural perspective, which is something new for me. Ken allows me to see the importance of cultural factors in mitigating the climate crisis and how each of us can begin with personal actions, and then collective actions or activism, and also try to influence the political world. Ken really broadens and deepens my understanding of the climate change, which I am really appreciative about. Previously, as Ken assume for most people, I think renewable energy is probably the most important thing to change the future for the climate, but now I see the priority more clearly. I also appreciate how Ken brought me to understand the importance of “first world solution to first world problems”, which I was barely aware of in the past. I also appreciate that Ken brought about many real-life examples of climate change promoters such as Greta Thunberg, Peter Kalmus, minimalists and all, who allow me to know that there are really people in the world fighting for the issue, and this is very encouraging. Finally, I appreciate the fact that Ken tries his best in his life to reduce his climate footprint, setting a good example of “being the change you want to see in the world” and encouraging us to do so as well.
<br><hr>
I would agree with you that number 17 is the most important of all of these things that you can do to be an environmentally aware and friendly human. It is like anything in life- if you have no motivation or drive to do it, then you probably won't succeed at doing it or you just won't do it at all. I know that my drive to "save the planet" comes from my personal appreciation of the ocean because I spend so much time in it surfing, swimming, and just hanging out with friends. Every time I jump in, I think to myself that picking up a few more pieces of trash on the beach or riding my bike instead of driving to the beach will allow me to enjoy the ocean the way people have before me, and it'll allow for people after me to enjoy it as well.

<br><hr>
Saving the planet is not one people’s business, it needs all kinds of people try their best to figure out the most efficient solution to solve environment problem. From my perspective, it is important for most company or industry to realize how much influential they can make through producing or operating. And they cannot be selfish only for their own profit. The planet is ours, but it not belongs to us, we are equal.
<br><hr>
First off, I wanted to thank you for the list. It is hard to keep up with all the points and things we should accomplish but you did a really good job on doing that. Passion is definitely the strongest emotion as it can drive us to do the right thing. We need to admit our world is falling apart and work tirelessly to ensure we save it.
<br><hr>
Being able to remain steadfast in a cause without seeing much change can be a difficult challenge. This could not be more true in the battle against climate change. Many activists have had their messages glossed over by other world events, and yet still continue to battle the powers that are damaging our Earth. In my own life, I find it difficult to continually try to reduce my emissions, as I feel my efforts are drowned out by the myriad of other pollutants provided by the industrial giants of America. However, when I feel that all hope is lost, I look to activists like Greta, who in her young age has received so much flak for simply wanting to have an inhabitable planet to live on. Its is through people like her that individuals like I are empowered and revitalized.

I really REALLY loved this video. While watching it I was reminded of the epic speech a coach gives at the end of a dramatic sports movie just before the team goes out and destroys their rivals. In this case, however, our entire generation is the sports team and our rival is the climate crisis. So much of climate rhetoric centers on what is WRONG and not HOW CAN WE FIX IT. Obviously, this is nessesary in order to motivate people to act, however, It is so refreshing to have such an uplifting lecture video in this class. While watching their were so many things that I thought to myself I could easily do and or do more. I want to thank Ken for taking on the daunting challenge of teaching this class. I was shocked as to why this class isnt more of a big deal around campus, especially after taking it. Every single student at this school should be throughly educated on what climate change is, why it is occuring, and most importantly what can we do about it, however, if i could recoment one resource from this entire course to one of my friends or family, it would be this video. We have a very grand challenge ahead of us, but we are well motivated, we are many, and we can be the generation to stop climate change. After all, what choice do we have?

There are two things I noticed in this video. First, will people start to follow these 20 guidelines? We’ve talk about being active in politics and society. I think it is important for the politicians to set new regulations based on these 20 guidelines, so that more people will start to take actions. Or, we have to repeat these 20 guidelines after 20 years again to our children. The second aspect I noticed is the technological solutions. People should use less private cars (fossil fuel cars) and use more public transportation. The e-cars should be recommended and well-spread. However, there is saying that e-cars have radiations that are harmful to human bodies. This problem should be solved as soon as possible.

<br><hr>

Hi there thank you for sharing and I completely agree with your comment! I think this lecture video is a great start for those of us and others who know about the appalling impacts of climate change on our planet and all of its lives and who want to take personal actions that matter and will help with alleviating the climate crisis. I would also recommend this video to my family, friends, and others around me because it is super educational in teaching people about the major important facts of climate change and helpful at the same time by offering those 20 things as a part of the greater solution to climate change. This video shows us that personal actions matter and are important in saving our environment and ourselves because together we can really make a difference and cause positive impacts on our environment. Of course, it is important to address the problems with the animal agriculture industry and fossil fuel companies with the enormously large amount of carbon dioxide they release into the atmosphere, but as ordinary citizens, we should start with making changes in our personal lifestyles and in our daily lives and the ways we go about our days. Meanwhile, we should be politically active and exercise our right to vote by voting for politicians who have the environment and climate change in mind and will pass laws and policies limiting the carbon emission from animal agriculture and the fossil fuel industries. If we are able to do both, then I sincerely believe that we are not too far from success.
<br><hr>
Your comment makes me think of the effect these guidelines will usher. For me, I think the first ten guidelines are more effective. Then, the last ten guidelines are less effective. I guess it is hard to persuade some people that personal change matters, and it is hard to persuade other people that political activism matters as well. But, it is okay. No matter what categories people fall in, they just need to follow what they believe in, i.e. political activism or personal change. Individuals should follow the guidelines, and at the same time, persuade and lead others to join them, to join the action of protecting the Earth. Actually it’s protecting humans. The more people involved in, the more people are protected (this is one of the sentences Ken said before the 20 guidelines).

<br><hr>
I also agree with the following comment and believe this video was very encouraging and welcoming. This video was very well thought out and could be shown to pretty much anyone because it does not require any prior knowledge about the climate crisis or about the earth in general in order to understand and relate to this video. The video clearly states the problems followed by what we can do personally to help this problem and I realized while watching the video that most of these changes are really just simple changes that do not require us to drastically change our whole lifestyle. I think videos like these and the subject of the climate crisis should be publicized more on school campuses as well as in the world in general. Many people today are not aware of the harm we are doing and the thing that is capable of turning this destruction around the most in us humans.
<br><hr>
I agree. I think this video was a great way to conclude the course, and it reminded us that change starts with us. This class has definitely impacted me and how I view things. I am more conscious of my own actions, and I try to do what I can in order to help the environment. I must admit, however, that the class is like a bubble. Because while I am changing my ways, I am under the illusion that everyone else must be as well. But that's not true. Not everyone is taking this class, so not everyone is attempting to change their lives in small ways. So I agree that this should be a bigger deal on campus. Don't make the class a requirement, but maybe create a small 2-3 hour workshop and make that a requirement. The climate crisis affects every single human on Earth, so it would make sense to educate as many people as we could on this subject.
   <br><br>
I am always open to hearing every side to a debate, and I enjoyed this class because it challenged me to listen to people's opinions without a bias, and then form opinions for myself. The class also reminded me of the importance of being well-informed on everything you choose to support. I think everyone, regardless of political party, should give both sides of the debate a chance, and maybe then we'll have more support for action against climate change.  think a lot of our duties as students of this course is just to spread the word and gain support. We are the beginning.

<br><hr>

I also enjoyed this video. I thought it was amazing that the list Ken gives us are things that don’t require much difficulty. I was quite surprised, as we talked about all these topics throughout the quarter, that I had already adapted to some of these personal changes. At the beginning of the quarter I did not believe that I would learn much about how big of an impact our personal actions have on our environment. As this quarter is coming to an end I believe this course should be shared among other students. I also believe that it is important to share this video with our friends and family as it perfectly summarizes what we can do to have a positive impact on our planet.
<br><hr>
I think so as well. Even, the 860 students in our class, may not take action because it is hard to do so, and because they don’t want to do so. Also, for this class, it is hard for UCSB to offer it every quarter. I heard that there was Engl 22 in last quarter, and Engl 23 this quarter, and Ken said that there will be a freshman seminar in next quarter, all about the climate crisis. I think every student should take some time and experience this series of courses, not for their major requirement or GEs, but for the shared habitat of human beings.

<br><hr>
 We do have our own periodical in UCSB. I do suggest UCSB to recommend courses such as Engl 22/23 on these periodical so that more and more students will learn about the issue of the climate crisis. Then, at least some of them will start to take action. In fact, even when one person start to change, one small impact will appear. It is valuable to start taking action now, because time matters. The sooner people start to take action, the earlier the Earth will be saved from being doomed.

<br><hr>
I also love this video. We have learned so much in the past 2 months through readings, documentaries and lectures. Not everyone in the world can do this because of time constraints but everyone does have the time to watch this video. Ken suggested if we were to show one video to our friends it would be this one. I think that too because even though it doesn’t go into depth it provides many simple changes that everyone can do. Most of these changes I have undertaken myself over this course. By taking this class I have actually changed I believe. I’m not the same person I was when I started. I would call myself a climatarian, someone who is opposed to fast fashion (not a minimalist yet, but working on it), I vote with my wallet, I voted for candidates that support climate initiatives and I have communicated with friends and family about the content of our class. This has also changed my parents eating and consuming habits. I have a new dream of living in a city, without a car in a small apartment. I have changed my major to environmental studies! I believe that this was good first class on my way to living a sustainable life.
<br><hr>
I respect those people who start to take action immediately. They are not making small changes, but in a way that really impacts the environment. People who are still giving speech such as Greta Thunberg really should learn from people who are taking action. From now on, live a sustainable life. Plant trees in the neighborhood. Help people who live in disadvantaged area. Action will make other people move, not speech.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with you that this lecture was a long time coming. As you said, compared to everything else we’ve been watching and reading in this class so far, I believe this one gave me the most hope that we might actually be able to reverse the effects of the climate crisis to a further and better extent than what we’re doing right now. Ever since the start of this class, every pessimistic reading and film has instilled a sense of urgency that I actually think was needed to first get me to pay attention to the issue at hand. Now that I’m properly watching and paying attention, this lecture was successful in motivating me to do even more and try harder to change my habits to contribute to a solution. These feelings arising in me make me wonder if perhaps the layout of the readings and films of this class were actually a quite intentional move made by Ken? He started off with articles full of fear and urgency that made a good job of scaring me as well as a reader. However once we see the magnitude of what we’re facing, Ken then hits us with a load of optimism and videos instructing us on how we as individuals can begin to make an impact. Whether or not this format was intentional, it was-at least in my opinion- very effective in rallying me to this movement and convincing me to make more change. This could not have been a more perfect ending lecture.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your idea. Watching this lecture video is like reviewing all materials and core messages of this course. I find Ken did a great job combining the interrelationship and mutual importance of personal action, collective activism, political action, and communication that could mitigate climate crisis in cultural, economic, and political changes rather than technological solutions. As you said, I am glad that this video can be used to educate my friends and families about what practical activities they can do to mitigate the climate change. Also, Ken mentioned many readings and films that we already seen before, concatenating them in a way that helps me to understand his list of 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet. 
   <br><br>

I believe that all of these solutions are necessary and significant to enforce. Although Ken mentioned that this list aims at developed countries, I think that developing countries should also learn the knowledge of climate crisis and start some of these actions such as birth control and educating. For example, China has already implemented many policies regarding birth control and effectively prevent overpopulation. Imagine that without government’s understanding of birth control, China would produce much more pollution and burden to natural resources. Moreover, educating knowledge about climate change is vital for people in the developing world to avoid following America’s steps which encourage massive use of fossil fuels and overwhelming consumerism. If developing countries learn that they must avoid damaging exploitation of natural resources, the increasing tendency of climate crisis would be controlled. Overall, we need to act upon the knowledge and do as many actions as possible in our daily life with the environmental awareness.

<br><hr>
I suggest we move away from only thinking about how awesome this lecture is, but rather start to think and take actions that illustrated in this lecture and really avoid the climate crisis. Only do real things can make the situations better. It is not hard actually. One small change every day done by many people can make a difference. When time passes, these difference will result in a better future.

<br><hr>
First of all, let me point out that, this video will not make our score in the final exam better, lol.
   <br><br>
It is valuable to contrast how different countries deal with the climate crisis. From the contrast, people can know what they can do and cannot do. When different countries are learning from each other, the globalization can be achieved, and the climate crisis can be mitigated. Right solutions will be recommended, and wrong action will be stopped.
<br><hr>
I agree! I really loved this video and it is probably my favorite lecture video. It honestly does kinda feel like the super intense but inspiring speech before a huge game or battle. Which I believe is a good way to personify the climate strike because it really is a battle that we must fight within ourselves to propel change. This video and others made me feel like i can implement many changes into my life and contribute further into fighting the climate crisis. After taking this class it left me wondering why this class isn't a required GE. It has been by far the most informative and relatable class I have taken.
<br><hr>
For students whose first language is English, it should be valuable for them to minor or double major in English Studies. Then, Engl 23 will be a required course. It not only talks about the English culture, but also talks about the climate crisis.
   <br><br>
I agree with the idea that these changes start from changing ourselves rather than persuade others. It is actually harder to change ourselves compare to change others.

<br><hr>
This video is something that truly should be shown to every single student on campus and to students on other campuses. As Ken said, education is one of the biggest things that we can do to help the environment. I see it as if we don't educate people, then they don't know what they can do to help and will continue emitting as much carbon as possible without realizing it. If we want the environment to change, we have to get this information out there and we need more people to rise up and start worldwide trends that will better our climate. It's not something that's easy but people need to know what they can be doing and our government needs to start paying attention and get their heads out of their asses. Do we want to be the generation that knew exactly what to do and how to fix our planet but was too fixated on stupid politics and our phones, or do we want to be the generation that helps save future generations to come? Think about that. Watch this video. Send it to your friends and families. Sit down and have a conversation about what you can start doing to make changes. And don't act like there is nothing you can do because you wanna still eat meat or you can't stop flying. Everyone can do something!! Let start making this planet one that we want to live on.
<br><hr>
Cooperation should be valuable at the step toward solving the climate crisis. People need to gather everybody’s contribution so that the situation can change. I think laws and regulations about protecting the environment should be set to urge people to change their lifestyles. Individual’s movement may not be strong enough but once people gather all the humans, the impact will be huge.

<br><hr>
YES! I LOVE YOUR ANALOGY! In fact, it reminded me of high school musical! 
   <br><br>

At the very beginning of the High School Musical 3 movie, there is a scene in which the wildcats are in the middle of losing their very last basketball game of the season. During half-time, the boys are all very depressed that they're losing. Coach Bolton comes in, sees how hopeless they look, and says the following: "Forget about the scoreboard! Cuz here's the number that matters: 16. There's 16 minutes left... there's only 16 minutes left in this game... there's only 16 minutes left in this season! For the seniors on this squad... guys... you've only got 16 minutes left in a wildcat uniform... so make it count. 16 minutes to be a team." Then, Troy Bolton says "It's now or never." The boys storm the basketball court singing "16 minutes left better get it done" and "16 minutes get ready game on" and "16 minutes left running out of time" and "16 minutes left and it's on the line". Troy sings "we gotta work together" and "show 'em we can do better". 
   <br><br>

In a VERY dramatic strut down the court, Troy sings "The way we play tonight is what we leave behind! It all comes down to right now it's up to us. So what are we going to be? T-E-A-M!" and "this is the last time to get it right... this is the last time to make our mark, history will know who we are... it's now or never!" 
   <br><br>

We are losing the game but there is still time left, and that's all that matters! We can't give up. This is our final chance. The entire future of mankind depends on us. We're all in this together!
<br><hr>
I too really enjoyed this lecture. I like your analogy a lot and when Ken said he had done over 30 lectures it made me realize how much he truly does care about spreading knowledge. He does this for our class but our job should now be to spread what we have learned so that it affects more than just 800 people. This lecture summarized everything we have talked about and made it seem very doable. The idea of creating more communities rallied around the idea of saving the planet is a great one.
<br><hr>
I agree! This video was so important. I think this video is so valuable because so many of these changes are ridiculously easy. While this video excellently wraps up the course for us, people who stumble upon this video or who we share this video to will benefit in enormous amounts from watching it. I think that we need to note how many ways there actually are to make a difference. What I also appreciated about this video is that there are such a wide range of different actions that there are so many ways people can incorporate sustainable changes in their lives. For example, not only eating with less meat and with seasonal foods, but also purchasing only the food you need and producing less food waste is extremely important. This is such an easy fix. 
   <br><br>

While it can be extremely hard to convince people to make changes that may alter their lifestyle, I strongly believe that this video allows for so many different changes to be made even if you are strongly against making large lifetime changes. Even incorporating these changes in the smallest way would benefit the environment severely. Paying more attention to videos like this is where we need to focus our attention. Ken does not come on too strong but alternatively he presents the issue, demonstrates the facts and explains how we can contribute to fixing it. This is a very important method to have when approaching such a controversial issue.

<br><hr>

I love the analogy. After watching and reading about the terrible things we are doing to our Earth, this video gave me the right amount of motivation. Too much of the same rhetoric can make you overly anxious or not at all anxious enough. The pressure is on, but this video also helped me to relax and get active. I am also shocked how people on campus aren't making a big deal out of this course as they do with other classes. Still, I am excited that this class was large with about 700 people because, now, perhaps, most of these people will become part of the advocacy for the climate crisis--this includes myself. I have been raging to my friends about all the things I learned in this class and told them if they did not want to take the class, we could definitely watch the eye-opening films that awoke me to this issue. My friends and family are educated a little about the issue but are not as passionate or as concerned as we all should be. That worries me. I am determined to do the best I can to go forth and multiply that motivation to act on the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
I agree with you. This lecture video is so excellent that it includes most things I want to know, and I learned in this class. Most of the time, when I introduce the global warming problem to my friends who do not take this class or who have no idea about what this kind of problem is and how serious this is, they will ask me a question- How to solve it. In most situations, I will become speechless and do not know how to explain this question to them due to the fact that I got so much information in this class, and I have no idea about which piece of information I should say first. Thanks to this video, I believe that it will be an excellent instrument that can help me to propagandize this topic to my friends and family members. Most solutions and changes that professor Hiltner mentioned in the lecture video is practicable from my perspective. For example, taking public transportation and biking more. These kinds of actions not only can reduce carbon dioxide, but also let our life become more healthy and effective. Also, using people's vote rights to fight for our own future is another inspired solution. We must consider our offspring's life. 
   <br><br>
Because of clarifying the solutions clearly, I believe that there will be more and more people focus on this question in the future and it can be solved as soon as possible.

<br><hr>

I applaud Ken for summarizing the class and his lectures in a twenty-four-minute video very well. I also really like your metaphor of the coach’s epic speech, it’s a very creative and funny way to compare Ken’s call to action of combating climate change. 
   <br><br>

The list consists of 20 things that we can do to combat climate change and while it seems like a lot of things that we can do, most of the points that Ken made were pretty repetitive. The list, when typed out, does not look too bad or too difficult to actually execute and incorporate in our lives. The list stood out to me because there were ways that I (and others who can relate), a broke and struggling college student, could see that can save me a lot of money. For instance, taking public transit instead of paying for expensive gas to fill up my car, living mindfully with smaller minimal spaces or even co-housing, and eating consciously with a plant-based diet and save money buying bulk grains and veggies rather than paying for more expensive poultry such as red meat.
   <br><br>

I couldn’t help but notice the comments of bots and people who are not students of English 23; Ken’s video and his list can be very controversial to the American public because we, as a society, are so used to depending on material items and living comfortably while eating meat and driving around in cars. Some dude commented about if we wanted to go back to when Canada used to be a mile long glacier? Since Ken is getting some traction from people outside of English 23 and UCSB, people are going to be more aware of the situation and either make the environmentally conscious choices that Ken provided or choose to rebel against it and live their comfortable, earth-harming lifestyle. I agree with you that the classes with Ken (English 23 AND English 22) should have more exposure and become a bigger deal to the students at UCSB, I think that we could really become a catalyst to a cultural and lifestyle shift to our generation.
<br><hr>

I agree with your point about how refreshing it is to hear about all the solutions that we can make happen for climate change. I think with any issue or obstacle it’s important to stay positive and find the light at the end of the tunnel. Although the light may be very dim and seem just too far to reach, if you lift that negative fog from plaguing your mind and focus on a proactive plan for change, the light will seem much brighter. One thing I noticed in the movies, “Being the Change”, “Minimalism, and. “Happy” is how uplifting and optimistic they are. I think the key to fighting for change is to stay positive. While we must recognize the issue and recognize what is wrong, it is important to turn that around and find solutions rather than meditate on how daunting the situation is. 
   <br><br>

Taking this class has truly made a big impact on my life and I feel that this class should almost be required. Although this is unrealistic, it is now the job of those who have gotten the privilege to take this class to spread the word and use our new communication tactics to educate those around us. Luckily we live on a somewhat eco-friendly and sustainable campus, which makes it easier to advocate and make personal decisions that align with being a climatarian.

 Wow. I guess Ken should upload a new video about the difficulties of making actions next week. This thing, protect the environment, really isn’t slogan and lyrics. Avoiding the climate crisis requires a lot of hard actions and movements. Giving speech doesn’t help, no matter it is positive speech or negative speech. People should always remind themselves of Greta Thunberg. Only when action is taking, can the situation be changed.


<br><hr>
 I agree with the idea of spreading these out. It is really important for more and more people to realize the significance of protecting the environment. I appreciate what Ken is doing. There are not a lot of people who are playing the role of the beginner. Ken is the beginner who knows the relation between the climate crisis and what people can do about it. I hope more and more people can know Ken’s thought, so that they can start to avoid the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
That’s a really cool analogy and it's very inspiring in a way. I really agree that this video was very refreshing and inspiring, considering a lot of the material that we saw early in the quarter. It went from deep problems and hard to resolve issues to inspiring very quickly and this tone shift was very much needed. I agree that like you, this video showed me many options and things that I can do myself to try and make a change. My only question with this is realistically, how many people can we get on board in both terms of numbers and speed, in order to make a significant difference? While these ideas are great and achievable, will enough people do it and create significant change? I know that that is a pessimistic approach to things but I feel like it's the more realistic one unfortunately.

<br><hr>
These twenty guidelines may not be the first time people heard of them. Ken may not be the first person who speak out these twenty guidelines. They may already appeared a long time ago. Yet, people barely make changes.
   <br><br>
When most people don’t want to make changes, the only solution is we change from ourselves. From now on, we don’t damage the environment. Less private cars, more walking, etc.

<br><hr>

I feel the same way, I was hoping throughout the duration of this course for a video just like this - a summary of ALL the personal/collective actions we can take as well as the impact of each of them. I personally felt so motivated watching this video because of how simple and accessibly the majority of these actions are. I also appreciated that Ken summed up the most important things about the course such as the most important quotes and films. I plan to send this to my friends whenever I am asked about my lifestyle changes, so that they will see some of the things they can do to help too. I think the most significant change in my individual actions will be in my food consumption. This class has really motivated me to be more conscious of what I eat and how it is affecting the planet, but most importantly it exposed me to the realities of how food waste affects the climate. I had never ever considered food waste as a climate issue, and learning that the average American's emissions in food waste alone are more than the average Bangladeshi is just insane. I will definitely be more conscious of my food waste from this point forward and I plan to start a compost once I can move out of the dorms, I think it would be a really fun way to lower my carbon footprint. Another huge change I want to make is adopting minimalism into my life. I had heard of minimalism since I was in high school and the lifestyle always appealed to me for personal reasons. However, after watching the True Cost and learning about fast fashion, I was completely and utterly shocked at how consumerism has become such a human rights issue, as well as a climate one. I will definitely never forget the feeling of sadness while watching the True Cost and I will keep this in mind whenever I feel tempted to purchase a top I really don't need just because of the low price. I will also recommend this film to all of my friends and hope it sparks the same desire to change as well.

<br><hr>
I really liked this analogy of a coach rallying his team before sending them off to a big game, and in a sense your comment is on point with exactly what ken is doing. Seeing as this is one of our last lecture videos, Ken is putting forth all the knowledge we have gained this quarter into one video to show us just how easy it is to enact change in our personal life. Ken has done his job on educating us, now it is our duty to stand by this awareness we gained, and fight for climate activism. I completely agree with you about how a lot of the focus has been on the things humans, up until this point, have done wrong and there hasn't been enough talk about what we can do from here, which is why I found this video so refreshing. As you mentioned, it is our problem (our being this generation) to stop the climate crisis, in the hopes our children don't have to be raised in a world of fire in which self interest and greed dominated the fight for a cleaner, safer and happier planet to live on.
<br><hr>
I appreciate how much you use the word "WE" in this comment. Ken has mentioned it many times in this lecture and throughout the course, but it needs to be repeated: this has to be a team effort. Overcoming the challenges of making vast changes in our lives is so much easier if others around us do the same. Good peer pressure is real! People find it easier to go on diets, get into an exercise routine, or make any change in their lifestyle if they have a buddy to do it with. Ken focuses on a lot of things that we can do together to make the world a better place, such as reducing food waste and switching to a better diet. I am a competitive person, so I would go about it with my friends in a competitive sort of way: whoever wastes less food, bikes more, and eats less meat wins. It is a great way to spur competition and to help solve the most pressing issues in our society!
<br><hr>
I really enjoy watching this video because Professor Ken provides 20 useful solutions that can help us combat the climate crisis, including what we should do on the personal level and society level. I prefer the first 10 solutions about personal activism because climate activism on a personal scale is more practical for most of us.  If everyone willing to have an eco-friendly lifestyle, there would be a positive impact on the climate crisis. In addition, I really agree with the idea that education helps us mitigate the climate crisis. Education not only helps reduce the birth rate, but also increase environmental consciousness among people. It is a great way to mitigate the climate crisis in a long term perspective.
<br><hr>
I agree that the second half of this quarter has DEFINITELY been more positive and optimistic compared to the first half of the quarter. We've been focused on what could be done to help slow down the problems that are causing the climate crisis. Quite frankly all of the solutions aren't far fetched.  All of the proposed actions in this class are all in reach. Some may be difficult to overcome but we all know that we will need to be willing to fight to save the planet. It will be a long process but I believe that it could be done. Showing people it can be done will definitely help the cause because I know some people are hesitant to change because they don't know what lies ahead. Even I was skeptical of some of the things that have been mentioned and honestly surprised how  easy it is to contribute to the cause. Project Draw-Down definitely does a great job in laying out what should be our priorities. There is hope for this planet.
<br><hr>
I really loved your comment, Kassie :) It reflects exactly how I feel about this video! And your coach comparison was excellent! There's nothing more motivating than a coach giving a speech before they face their rivals and Ken did an excellent job in preparing us and making us motivated to fight our big rival, the climate crisis! All those solutions people have commented and made into a list really really can be accomplished and the best thing is that all of them will make our lives better AND our planets. I cannot see a bigger win, win. Most of the things just require us to look into ourselves and that's what growth is. This isn't something we should fear because these changes are all beneficial! Like purchasing less food and making conscious choices will help our wallets and our health. Using birth control, biking, and living in smaller homes will only save us more and more money. Electing people who are conscious about the environment and our problems and advocating for what we know is right which is saving the planet are all things we have the power to do. This information is gratefully ours now; it is now our job to put these things into action, if not all, most. All the ones we can possibly do. Even spreading around this video could do so much. Sharing it to the people we know (like in our social media) can do so much. Not everyone would watch it I understand, but there will for sure be at least one person who would and that alone can make a huge difference. I just think education is the biggest player here today. WE have the opportunity to receive it and learn from it. We have to do our part in spreading the importance our actions have on this planet and the way it benefits us ten times more like for example we'd be happier if we really put our effort into all of this

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. Honestly coming into UCSB I had never taken an environmental course and was not really involved or aware of the intensity of the climate crisis at ALL. I knew "global warming" was occurring, but I didn't realize it was to this extent, I had no idea Americans were so far over on the"goal" of CO2 emissions. I also didn't realize all the things I was doing to contribute that CO2. My mom always told me to turn lights off when I left a room, and raised me on a healthy plant based diet but I didn't truly understand why. I genuinely look back and wonder how I could be so naive, but I know its because I didn't have these resources, I hadn't taken a class like this or looked at a single article on the environment, I am ashamed of it, but feel like the effect of this class was so strong on me because of it. 
   <br><br>
I used to be a fast fashion shopaholic, and within the past few months I have stuck to thrifting. I used to eat beef tacos every time they had them at the dining hall and now I haven't had them in over a month. I am more conscious with the foods I buy, and trips I planned for the summer, and feel very mindful about all the decisions I am making. If I consciously make a decision that may be more harmful to the environment I feel guilty about it, and in a strange way I think this is a healthy attitude to have.
   <br><br>
I can't believe this isn't a mandatory class in college, let alone high school. I feel as though this is a topic everyone should be aware of, and isn't always easily made to be due to the false skepticism revolving around it. I also feel like because this is a liberal school people are more embracive of the material than people in other cities or especially states would be. This is concerning seeing as the people who care the least are the ones who need to know and act on this information the most.
<br><hr>

I agree with Kassie that many people know what is wrong with the climate crisis and that emissions are promoting global warming but many do not know the solutions to lower the emissions produced by us.  This video is a good overall review of what the class has been discussing over the ten weeks.  We looked about many sides of the climate crisis with solving the issue, why the issue is not talked about by some politicians, how emissions vary place to place etc.  I think the knowledge in this video should be basic knowledge everyone should know and I think many people choose to share this video with others to inform them about the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
I have to join you in thanking Ken for the amazing thing he’s done with this class. He undoubtedly already follows all or most of the guidelines he laid out in this video, reducing his own emissions in every practical way, but the impact of his teaching and educated activism cannot be activated. Ken has gone above and beyond his duty to the planet, taking up the daunting task of communicating the complexity of the issue to arguably the most important audience on the planet: the future. In educating us budding minds on the issues that our planet and species face, Ken is slowly but surely directing the human population towards a future of battling for sustainability.

<br><hr>
I think you’re right to choose this as the video to recommend to people. It’s what so many of us need; a clear and expansive list of ways that we can actually fight this thing. I also really agree with you that it’s surprising that this class isn’t more known on campus. I thought the same thing at the beginning of the quarter. I think what makes this class so special is that you don’t even have to be enrolled to reap the benefits. Ken really practices what he preaches; he knows that in order to do something about this crisis, people have to understand it, and thus he makes it available to anyone who is curious enough to make a change.

<br><hr>
The first sentence of this comment sums it up, I loved this video. It was not only inspiring, but also produced awe. It was an unusualy uplifting video compared to most lecture videos. This class has truly made me more cognizant of not only the environment and the world, but of the people in it. The class is challenging me to make changes that not only help the environment but also simultaneously help me become a better human being and a happier human being. I truly feel that the mass majority need to have the blessing of being able to learn what I and my other classmates have had the opportunity of learning. I feel if everyone at least had the information, and was exposed to all sides of the climate crisis, we would be able to not only make changes that save the planet, but more importantly make changes that change the relationship we have with everything around us. From the random person in my English class, to a homeless man on the streets, all the way to my mom back at home.
<br><hr>
I was thinking the same thing about Ken sounding like a motivational coach prepping his kids to go out and crush it at a game and in a way that's really what he's actually doing for us. I was very confused as to why I had never heard or seen anyone else talking about this class in my past quarters at this school, considering that the content of the course are things that should be mandatory for every college-educated student at this school to be aware of. I'm even more disheartened at the fact that I potentially could have missed this class if not for my frantic search to find a class that matched my writing requirement on GOLD and missed out on all this amazing and life-changing information. Ken has really equipped us with knowledge that allows us to go out and change the world, whether its through increased participation in climate activism or getting a group of about 1000 kids to be more mindful about possible lifestyle changes that are environmentally conscious. I for example have stopped shopping in department stores and on online sites like Amazon, opting to only thrift or buy locally for the things I need. Definitely I have also started to take more time to consider what truly makes me happy and whether my lifestyle choices are beneficial to support either the environment or my own individual happiness for the matter. Watching documentaries and reading statistics that supported these ideas was also very crucial to me taking these steps to change the way I live, and for that I really do have to thank Ken for giving me this information in the first place. 
   <br><br>

Although I do still feel a bit pessimistic about the fate of the earth (especially with our current administration and not high hopes for future ones), I feel glad knowing that at least I have the knowledge and tools to spread environmentally conscious ways to live to the people in my life and make my own voice heard. I really want to start going to climate rallies near me and have even begun to research ways to get more involved on campus or back home as well. The world is in our hands after all and it is up to people like us to do something about its fate before its too late.


<br><hr>
After watching this lecture video I was very excited and anxious to start to make a change to the planet. I love how Ken lists the changes we need to make to the planet instead of telling us what is wrong with it. I definitely felt that I could make a change to my current lifestyle for the better of the planet and have actually started doing since watching this video. I also agree very strongly with your point that every single student on campus should be thoroughly educated on the climate crisis. I actually think that Climate Crisis 101 should be a required class at the school. This will give every student an understanding of the climate crisis and how they can help the planet. I think if the school did this we would start to see a huge improvement to the community.

<br><hr>
We all appreciate that Ken sums up the most important 20 guidelines. Yet, this is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that we start to follow at least some of these 20 guidelines and make real change of our lives. We are not audiences of this planet. We are the dominator. We need to take power and protect the Earth. We should have real actions to follow these 20 guidelines.

<br><hr>
I really enjoyed the analogy you gave about being on a sports team and how your coach would hype your team up before going out and playing against your rival. As a former softball player and competitor, I resonated with this. I think it is important to think of the climate crisis as the ultimate enemy that we need to fight against because our society currently does not seem motivated enough to change. I loved the way Ken presented these 20 solutions of what we can do to save our planet because he not only described small personal actions you can take, but also political activism. We can not fight this battle alone and we need a whole generation willing to take these steps in order to have a livable environment in the future. Ultimately I believe that political activism is the first step to this immense problem because that is the only way we are going to force people to change. Unfortunately when there are not strong rules and regulation, much of our society would not be willing to change on their own. In this upcoming election, it is important the we spread the message to vote for candidates that support the Green Deal and a carbon tax. I think everybody at UCSB should take this class and become knowledgeable about the climate crisis. Like Ken has said many times, knowledge is not power if not put into action. If enough people at UCSB were to take this course, people would not only become knowledgeable about the topic, but want to take action since there is such a supportive community of environmental activists.

<br><hr>
I agree with the idea that now it’s our duty to start to take action. We should fight for climate justice. People did give a lot of speech on this issue in the past, and action is really required. The climate crisis is not only caused by the old generation. We are responsible for what is happening on the Earth as well. We should also consider what Earth the next generation will live on. It is really important that we make the Earth more habitable.
<br><hr>
Climate crisis is still caused by human, so the biggest problem is to stop people from polluting the Earth. Once more and more people are persuaded, the climate crisis is not a problem. People are capable of avoiding the climate crisis.
   <br><br>
Engl 23/22 is really recommended because it takes a cultural approach to environmental studies. Students can learn about the climate reality from numerous videos, documentaries, and papers. Yet, the most important thing is reflections.

<br><hr>

I agree I think a big step on doing something about the climate crisis is educating people on it and the various issues at hand. Also not just the issues but the many things we can do to take action both personally and as a whole society. We have a lot of work ahead of ourselves, but if we can inform and get  people motivated to do their own part I think we have a real chance of changing how we do things and changing things to be more eco friendly and save our planet.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment! This video is very refreshing because Ken took all the material of this course and explained it in a way that was overwhelming. My biggest problem with the climate crisis is that it seems too large to be able to do anything effective. However videos and messages like this one are very important in helping get over that fear and empowering people to take action. Taking action isn't as scary as it seems, and i'm reminded of this when I hear how simple change can be. I will definitely recommend this video to others who are interested in learning more about what they can do to be apart of the change. The climate crisis is a large and scary issue, but we can't let it inhibit us from progression. I think this is a great video to show people who aren't very informed on the issue because I think it will serve as motivation rather than overwhelm them.
<br><hr>
I agree that we have to be cognizant that we are in a class full of college students with a huge population from California who CHOSE to take this class (in some aspect or another). Although this list seems simple and positively frames how we can make change, sometimes we are our biggest opponent. I also hope politicians do set new regulations based on the 20 guidelines Ken proposes. Of course we can be part of that, but it is also very easy to see how politics can shut things down very easily and quickly. 
   <br><br>
But, I still feel like I got SO much out of this course and climate activism has become more important to me. I have spoken to others around me personally, have been posting about climate activism on social media and have integrated a number of personal actions and collective actions that we have discussed throughout the quarter. 
   <br><br>
Two key takeaways from this video alone for me were: (1) knowledge alone is not power and (2) embody change, join together, and demand it. The first motivates me to be more active about climate change and the latter motivates me to work with others to do so. I look forward to working towards new goals I did not realize until taking this course.

<br><hr>
I really like your sports coach analogy, and I think viewing Ken as our coach is a great way to look back on his class. A good coach is intelligent, informed, and passionate about what he is instilling in his team. If that's not the perfect way to describe Ken than I don't know what is. I remember after taking English 22 the first quarter of my freshman year that he continued to send out emails to those who enlisted in the class. They were always about a new piece of legislation, or a new way to get informed and involved in the climate crisis. He is relentless in fighting for what he sees as right, and leads by example. But at the same time, he isn't unreasonable. He lists 20 changes we can make in our lives that would help alleviate the effects of anthropomorphic climate change, and each and every one of them is attainable. Reducing our meat consumption, buying less unnecessary things, and flying less are all things that every person could do, and that's what makes this class great. While I will have to admit that some of these changes are highly improbable, he has given me hope that I didn't have before. He is the perfect coach.

<br><hr>
I definitely agree! At the beginning of the quarter I used to believe I was aware of many issues regarding the climate crisis, but as we continued with he course I realized my knowledge on it wasn't as great as I thought it to be. The more we learned, the more hopeless I felt about some of these issues being resolved. However, I always held onto hope that the changes Ken would tell us to make would work. In my own life they did end up working! Before I was less conscious of where I shopped or ate, but now I take the time to research and consider whether or not my actions will have a negative impact on the environment. I've successfully stopped shopping at Forever 21 and other fast fashion brands and found alternatives to cow's milk. The changes Ken mentioned in this video were easy to adapt into my own life that at some point I would do it unconsciously. Apart from that I found myself telling my peers about this class and changes they could make. Although some were hesitant, I've been able to convince my housemate to switch to more sustainable alternatives. Apart from that, I also agree with you on the idea that more people should take this class. Not only are you fulfilling requirements, but you're able to expand on your knowledge and address a real world issue that is happening in our lifetime.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that this video did a great job reiterating what we have learned in class, and gives us a surge of hope to go and cause change in the world. I really enjoyed that Ken was able to seperate the twenty things into two categories. It allows people to pick and choose what works best for their lifestyle and create a positive change in the world. For example some people do not have the privilege of voting for officials that represent their values and needs for their community, yet they can still show their support through their own personal choices. Also to those who don't have the freedom of choosing their own personal choices whether it be from a financial strain or accessibility strain can ensure that their voices are being heard politically. This is extremely important because the big picture isn't to partake in every single opportunity, but to do the best we can with the resources that we are presented with.
   <br><br>


Personally I think the action that holds the most value for my lifestyle is use knowledge to share and implement solutions and voting for environmental initiatives. If we were able to make this knowledge more accessible whether it be sharing this site with our loved ones or demonstrating to others the actions they can part take in to live more sustainably. This could help shift the demand to corporations because we often forget their our dollar acts as a vote. Also with voting you are ensuring that your values are being voiced and can create a domino effect on the way we live our lives.


<br><hr>

I completely agree with you. Unless I'm mistaken, I think that this class is fairly new to the university, which is why I'm hoping this class isn't more of a big deal on campus. After more quarters of this class happening, I really hope that more people know about it. I also hope that Ken can teach this class every quarter, which I don't know is professionally feasible for him, but I think it would be really beneficial to the campus and the planet--if not him, then he could recruit other professors to teach the class as well so that it could be offered every quarter. I also think that this class should be a GE. I know, I know, nobody wants to add more GE classes and I hear so many people complain that they hate taking GE classes and they shouldn't be wasting their time of classes that aren't applicable to their major. I disagree with these sentiments for a variety of reasons, but even if I did agree with those students, I would still advocate to make this class a GE. The climate crisis affects everyone and will only become hellishly worse if we don't do something about it. It is therefore our humanly responsibility to act to fight the climate crisis and education is the first step. Since we are all living in the developed world and are all privileged enough to go to college, it is even more of our responsibility to be educated and act on the climate crisis. This class was not that difficult, but we learned a lot about the climate crisis, but more importantly things that we can do to effectively and efficiently fight against the climate crisis. And if everyone at UCSB were required to take this course, the possibility for action on this campus and in our community could be amazing. If everyone on this campus received the same climate knowledge as our class has, we would have the potential to change the campus, IV, Goleta, Santa Barbara, and even farther to make our world a healthier place. Ken gave us this video to summarize what we as students could do to help fight against the climate crisis, so I'm giving Ken this comment to summarize what he can do (in his unique role as a climate scientist activist who is a professor to a large number of people) to help fight agains the climate crisis more than he already is.

<br><hr>
I thought the same way! This lecture video gave me more useful information that I can take into effect in my own life as well as educating myself to then educate others. I agree with you that many people need motivation and reason to contribute to saving the planet. Nobody is going to want to change their lifestyle just because they were told that they should but rather they should be given the reasons why and how this is meaningful to themselves and the rest of the world. People need to be educated on the facts and then decide if they want to be the change for our world. In order for people to be the change, they need to realize what is important to them and why they want to make these changes. Like this people will have something to achieve for and therefore be more motivated to contribute to a more sustainable and healthy environment. I also agree that much more people should be aware of what is occurring with our planet at the moment to create a more powerful activist group to confront those who deny the climate crisis. We are all together in this world and we only have one livable planet at the moment so why shouldn't we try and start saving the planet now. Making minor changes will do no harm so let's start with those but we should also make a change and vote if we can to create a political government that believes in saving the planet because this will be one of the major things to conquer first to then begin making major changes in our daily lives. Together I believe in ourselves.


<br><hr>
If more and more people are thinking of this problem in this way, the situation will be much better than it currently. Also, I do believe that people (especially new generations) shouldn’t completely count on this on politicians. We have to do something to mitigate the climate crisis. It’s not worth playing around and waiting for the politicians to move because that would be too late.
<br><hr>
The thing is, as I said, this is definitely not the first time someone sum up 20 guidelines about what people should do. Ken may not be the first person/professor who sums up these 20 guidelines. I believe these 20 guidelines are already exist long time ago. Yet, why almost no one is taking action? Thus, I assume that after this quarter and the spring break, a lot of people will forget this issue again.

<br><hr>
Besides inform and educate other people, the most important thing I believe is taking action by ourselves. We must start to move first. We cannot wait until everyone is moving because that would be too late. Thus, from now on, the best way is, no more talking and praising, but completely do something that make sense and are beneficial to the Earth. I believe the situation will be better.

<br><hr>
I liked your sports team reference, because the team is only as strong as its weakest link. Every country putting aside their differences and conflicts to team up for the greater good in the battle of the earth, because all humans are on the same side; only together can we win.
   <br><br>


Most of this course content made me apprehensive and worrisome about the future and our current state of affairs. I've felt helpless because of how little of an impact I can make directly, and I stopped attending lecture for a little while because I did not want to feel that sense of hopelessness. However, I find comfort in this video, which summarizes the individual steps one can take to help make the change the want to see in the world. Sharing this video and its content with others and living in accordance with these new 20 Commandments is the answer I've been looking for and has helped my climate depression.
   <br><br>


Let's try to get this video trending on YouTube and go viral to spread the message ! Michael Jackson once said "I'm starting with the man in the mirror, I'm asking him to change his ways, And no message could have been clearer. If you want to make the world a better place, Take a look at yourself, and then make the change!"
<br><hr>

I completely agree. Because of this class, my mind was opened to more than I anticipated. I also agree that this must be a mandatory class at UCSB due to the intensity of the issue. I knew maybe 5% of the information prior to taking this class, and now I feel confident to inform others on the issue. It has also shifted my political view even more than it had at the start of college, and I realized that with my vote, I will vote for the candidate who prioritizes climate change over anything else. I feel very passionate about the issue due to Ken's lectures and readings, which I am very grateful for. Although the information is disheartening to hear, I am very optimistic about our generation and the change to come.

<br><hr>
I believe that personal effort can make a difference. Although individual cannot shake the whole world, he/she can still make small changes on the Earth. Do not feel hopeless about the situation. There are more than one people fighting for a better future. Although there are very few people doing this, there are at least some people who are awake and are doing real things. We should join them as well.

I am optimistic about the future too. Speaking of Engl 23 at UCSB, besides the midterm and the final exam, this is a wonderful course. A lot of my friends just don’t know how to prepare for the exam and what to review. Me neither. We have to pnp this course and cannot get a higher GPA. Yet, this is still a course worth listening and worth considering because we can learn a lot from it. And, we must take action to protect the environment!
<br><hr>
I couldn't agree more with your comment.  This video, like you said, is incredibly motivating and uplifting despite the constant alarmist rhetoric that centers around the climate crisis.  Not only is it incredibly refreshing, but it also motivates me more than anything to actually be proactive about the solutions regarding the climate crisis.  Like you said, Ken took an incredibly daunting challenge of teaching a class on climate change.  I think we can all agree by saying he did an amazing job teaching this class and making it fun in the process. I believe it should be a requirement amongst UC campuses to take a course similar to this one regarding the climate crisis.  Not only would this raise more awareness for our generation but generations in the future.  Having a class like this as a prerequisite to graduate will inspire millions of students both across California and the nation.  Proceeding forward, I believe that we can take this education that Ken has instilled in us and make great things out of it.  With this information, we are better prepared to make more informed decisions in our daily lives.

<br><hr>
I agree with you and think this was a good recap video. I have learned so much about the climate crisis and Ken did a great job of teaching the course. As we think of finding ways to educate the public on the climate crisis, we should consider making this a required course across all universities. This would serve as a good way of raising awareness to the problem and would definitely result in a positive movement. As people we need to try our best to reduce our carbon footprint and contribute the the cause at hand. We can refer to Ken's lists of ways to help our environment. If we actually want to see change and make a difference it us up to me and my generation to find resolutions and fix the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
I don’t think Ken feels ‘daunting’ to teach this topic. Also, I find out that a lot of classmates are motivated by this course. Thus, I am really really worried that people barely will start to take action on protecting environment. People get use to shout out slogan instead of do real things. People get use to blame others and find excuses. Yet, the most important thing is to find solutions and follow the solutions…
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you Kassie! I think more people should know about this class. I hope that people gain a meaningful experience and a new perspective on their own lives after taking this class.  This class is such an easy way for people to become more educated and truly feel more hopeful towards the climate crisis if this class succeeds in inspiring them in the way it has already inspired so many of us. Now I firmly believe that it’s all of our responsibilities to share our knowledge with the world. If we don’t have the time or capacity to change many of our individual habits to combat the climate crisis, the least we can do is share these resources we’ve been lucky to obtain from this course and share it with the people around us. Because as Ken said, knowledge itself is not power as it can be squandered if we don’t do anything with that knowledge. 
   <br><br>

That’s why the parts that I enjoyed most about these 20 things are the last couple points from 16-20 of the political activism list. Ken put it beautifully and clearly pointed out that becoming politically active about the climate crisis does not mean you must align your political ideologies one way, but merely you must educate and at the very least, think about it. Think and rethink the way we must shift the paradigm, and read, and share, and forge a new future rather than trying to go back to the past or ending this world for every non-human as we know it.


<br><hr>


I agree with this idea. If more and more people are doing the same thing, the situation will be much better. Besides solving the climate crisis, people should now focus on the progress of globalization. We share the same Earth (habitat), so we should be nicer to each other as well. When these things are achieved, the world will be a peaceful place with less war and conflict. It is important to fight for these things.
<br><hr>
The most important thing here really is not this video or whether we share it with friends or not…The most important thing is from now on we obey the 20 guidelines so that there can be changes. Only changes can change the situation. Simply appreciate this video cannot help the Earth because this can’t be the first time people watch the similar video. Then what did they do after watching? Nothing?
<br><hr>
I loved your analogy of approaching climate crisis as a team sport against a rival because in many aspects, it is very true. We will never win the battle against climate change if we all don't take the necessary individual actions to make a difference and if we don't work together. I played volleyball for seven years, and all throughout high school and the main thing I learned is that teamwork is everything. In order to succeed, you need to take care of your individual responsibilities before you can think about the team's success overall because ultimately, you can't control what you teammates do, you can only set them up for success. Much like volleyball, winning against climate change starts with individual changes that will amalgamate into one big collective change by all of humanity. An like any team dynamic, the best way to boost moral is to do your part and encourage others to keep doing their best.
<br><hr>
I suggest we don’t make any more analogy. This is wasting time. We should start to take action soon! Ken has already tell us what to do, then we just do! I really don’t suggest people giving too many speeches and talking, because speeches cannot help avoid the climate crisis. From now on, people can plant trees in the yard. People can consume less meat. People can accept at least some idea of minimalism…


<br><hr>
Thank you for your kind words of encouragement. I am passionate about this cause. After taking this course, I would consider myself a climate activist. However, I am doubtful Americans in general will become as dedicated to the climate crisis as our class is. I believe our generation is the one to ignite big changes to our system and culture, but i am still worrisome that Ken's generation he's been apologizing for can make the switch and see the light. A sad but true quote about one's age affecting their ideology is "If your not a socialist in your 20s, you don’t have a heart. If you’re a socialist when your 50, u don’t have a brain."  If only we could get the baby boomer generation to take professor Hiltner's class to see the truth for themselves. 

   <br><br>

Even if many Americans are unwilling to abide by this list, there is only one step that will be the most effective and easiest for everyone to complete- spending one hour a year to vote for a politician campaigning on the support to help the environment. Getting mass number of voter turnout to help delegate people to strike down and put handicaps on the fossil fuel industry will be much more influential and helpful to the cause than to painstakingly changing your way of life. If you love eat hamburgers, go vote for someone trying to keep America green. If you are a NASCAR driver, go vote for an environmentalist. If your family just moved into your dream house, go vote to put pressure on legislature to pass laws against the fossil fuel industry. It's the most practical and important way to help save the world.

<br><hr>


People are encouraged to vote across America. And…we’ve seen the results. Mr. Trump is the president. I honestly don’t know why people still want to encourage others to vote. Probably more and more people are voting now. Yet, why Andrew Yang failed in 2020 campaign? As far as I am concerned, politics cannot be rely on or be used as a tool to protect the environment. People still have to start action themselves first.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with this comment because this class really was uplifting for a class centered about how we are rapidly destroying our planet. This video was definitely very informational and something that should be shared with people out of this class. In a short 25 minutes, people could get a quick summary of what we’ve learned in this class and how we can make a difference no matter how small. Number 20 really stood out to me, with Ken telling us we should be the change we want to see in the world. That really impacted me, because I want to see change so badly yet I haven’t done anything except for making minor lifestyle changes. The facts that this video has so many views gives me hope, because it shows that other people do care and will spend time addressing how to be a better human being for the earth. Another fact that gives me hope is how many people took this class in hopes of learning subject matter that lets us be more environmentally friendly and address the climate crisis. 
   <br><br>

The best thing about this video is that out of the 20 solutions, most of them are so doable! While it does take effort to change one’s lifestyle we are in a transitioning part of our lives where we can make the next four years much more environmentally friendly. I’m so glad I took this class because I learned so much and have been able to make beneficial changes. This class really opened my eyes to fast fashion and the downsides of it. While it is cheap, I now am informed of the hidden costs to the earth and other people that I don’t see, but definitely still exist. Number 17 also hit me hard, because I am definitely very passionate about it and need to channel that passion into changing my lifestyle instead of just moping around and thinking about how the world is going to end.
<br><hr>
I still see that people are amazed by these 20 guidelines. Do they seriously have to be amazed every time when someone bring up 20 guidelines that can save this planet? Why not start take action at the first time? I suggest people take ownership of this Earth, instead of always been the audience. We have to do something for the Earth because what happen on the Earth directly impact us!
<br><hr>
I totally agree with you, I loved this lecture and it was very inspirational. I think in this lecture Ken hit it out of the ballpark as this lecture can be very useful in ways outside of this course. I think that lecture and any message similar can be immensely effective in convincing people to act. We are always told of the treat that is looming and how much little time is left but I believe something like this that shows us we have very good fighting chance is essential to motivate the rest of the globe to act now. I think positive encouragement is the best way that we are going to able to mobilize the world into action to Dave the planet and it needs to be spread on many more platforms.

<br><hr>
The spreading effect of this video has accomplished. Now, it’s important to see how people react to this. Will they start taking actions? If they don’t start taking actions and wait for next person who come up with 20 guidelines, these 20 guidelines are useless. The next 20 guidelines are useless as well. If people start to take actions, the impact of these 20 guidelines are huge. The climate crisis can be avoided.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your statement, especially the fact of how you managed to compare Ken's speech with a coach's pep talk within a dramatic sports movie. I found this lecture video to be the most profound and direct in offering solutions to mitigate the climate crisis. I think it is absolutely necessary for not only students taking this course to understand the deeper issue of climate change, but also for us to communicate to friends and family the broader issue. This video does an amazing job at being straight to the point and offering solutions toward a country heading toward a future filled with the consequences as a result from climate change. I feel that this lecture video offers anyone, even those not fully aware of the climate crisis issue a better understanding to incorporate some of these solutions. Now some may say that they aren't able to do all 20 of them, but honestly I would call b.s. anyone can incorporate these solutions in their everyday lives and it doesn't necessarily have to be going fully vegan or giving up your car, simply incorporating how a climatarian diet, and being less hateful with food, as well as simply voting if you have the option to do so. It is a wasted opportunity if you don't take advantage in voting for policies and people willing to mitigate the climate crisis. Even if this video is 24 minutes long, it's a good way to communicate to another person the importance of it, and to take the time to watch it so that they grasp a better understanding from one's point of view.
<br><hr>
I couldn't have said it better myself! This class was like one big environmental awakening for me. I have always known that climate change was a huge issue but until this class I did not know just how huge it really is. Rather than make me scared of what is going to happen to this planet due to the climate crisis, this class has given me hope and strength that we can fight this. Our generation is full of educated and driven people and I believe that we have the power to conquer this challenge. The first step would be to spread the word. Tell your friends and family about the crisis and how we can address the problem as individuals. The next step would be to take action. Eat less meat, take on a more minimalistic lifestyle, move away from fast transportation and fast fashion, etc. There are endless things that one could do. Also, be an activist! This is something that is highly underrated but shouldn't be! Thank you Ken but we can take it from here.
<br><hr>
After watching this video i've realized that there is many things that I can do to make a small impact on the climate. One of the most important things to me is electing government officials that have the climates best interest in mind. The regulation of greenhouse gas emission can only be governmentally implemented and therefore so we need to have people that are going to put the world before money. There is a choice in everyday life which can decrease or increase your carbon footprint. By Buying less, spending less, and using less we are able to save the resources we need for the future.  It is crazy that this class isn't that big of a deal because it seems like many people in college are environmentally aware of their roles in the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I really like how use used the comparison of Ken being our coach and giving us a great speech while us as a team destroy our rival. I think it was funny and really true. I think I felt motivated after watching this, but I feel that a lot throughout this class. While watching, I too thought of all of the things I can still change about my lifestyle. I also want to thank Ken for taking on this course and educating us more about climate change. I think we need more courses like this here at UCSB and just about everywhere else.
<br><hr>
I like your metaphor! I agree with you on how previous weeks we have been discussing how we have done so wrong and feel guilty about our behaviors (at least this is how I feel). Now finally approaching the ending of this course, Ken is telling us and motivating us to do something so that we can be the change. I want to thank Ken for designing this course from various perspectives. If it were not those documentaries telling us how bad the current circumstances are earlier this quarter, I would never urge myself to be part of the change. I will recommend my friends to this course so that more people can join us to be the change!

<br><hr>
I think your comment really captured how I felt this video as well. Hearing about the climate crisis often causes me to feel stressed out about the future. After all, hearing about the constant statistics about how urgent it is to take action now can make people feel hopeless when observing that there are still many people who do not take the climate crisis seriously. This video clearly outlines easy and accessible ways for all of us to limit our contribution to producing waste and greenhouse gases. Watching this video inspired me to write down all the easy ways I can reduce my carbon footprint. After taking these steps, I hope I can make larger, long term changes to my life to create a more sustainable lifestyle. I hope that watching this video will make others realize how easy it is to make small changes to their lives to create sustainable changes. Additionally, it's important to remember that that the climate crisis is a group effort and that everyone should do their part to create a better future for us all.

These 20 items, within 2 comprehensive lists of 10 as separated by the fact that 10 are personal actions and then the other 10 are collective and political action, are a great summary to this course.  Ken did a great job at really getting down to the core ways that people can make a difference when it comes to the climate crisis.  I really liked how he included solutions that encompass each sphere of action: personal, collective, and political.  He put it all together in a way that is very understandable and a great reference.  I definitely agree with him that if there is one video to refer a friend to, it would be this one.  Each of the 20 items are things that I have worked to and continue to work to implement in my life.  Taking action is vital and it all starts with one person.  With the action of one, more can and will follow.  With these guidelines we can be the change we want to see in the world and we can help others do the same.
 <br><br>
The items outline what everyone should strive to achieve in developed countries.  It is only right that we make these changes seeing as we are the ones who caused all this in the first place.  Now is the time to transform our knowledge into power after waiting far too long.  I hope that this video and/or its contents become widely known so as to cause massive change and combat the climate crisis before it is too late.  I encourage everyone to try employing at least one of these items so as to bring about the change.  With enough people making these valuable changes in their lives, we will be that much closer to causing the necessary change vital in our urgent situation.  With solutions like those stated by Ken, I feel optimistic, but we definitely have a long journey ahead of us.

 I wholeheartedly agree that these 20 items are a good summary of the course. Especially when considering the fact that 10 of these are personal actions, and 10 are collective actions. I think Ken does a good job of balancing personal actionable items with collective actionable items. With continued teaching of this course, I wonder how many people Ken will reach. Something repeated time and time again in this course is that change comes from within the individual. In response to Ken's segment on contraception. I find it appalling that our current administration wants to overthrow Roe v Wade. I find it upsetting that some conservatives value the existence of a fetal bundle of cells that is not considered alive by the biological classifications of life, over the well being of our planet and the woman carrying the fetus. I think that one of the more realistic of these changes that Ken proposes is living in a city. City-living is a trend that is happening regardless of the climate change movement. Public transit is a practical solution regardless of the climate change movement as well. Because of that, I think those two are the most likely to occur changes. I hope that people tomorrow (3/3-- super tuesday) will be casting their vote for candidates and propositions that enact important change towards climate change. Like Ken says voting is the most important thing we can do in regards to the climate crisis. Our individual actions serve no real purpose aside from leading by example to get others to act, alone we are weak, together we are strong.


<br><hr>

I agree with your statement that this video is a great recap of the course as a whole. I like that Ken highlights 10 different solutions for individual and collective action because both operate differently to prevent the climate crisis. For instance, collective action is more political and socially involving than individual action. Collective action is more to spread awareness while individual action is more dedicated to people who are already climate change activists and want to know how to reduce their emissions. Moreover, many of the solutions Ken proposes are relatively easy to implement in one's lifestyle. For instance, not wasting food simply requires people to be conscious of the leftovers they have and when they go bad. In addition, if people do not want any leftovers, they can always give food to other friends or homeless shelters. Having grown up in a household that recycles organic waste, Composting is also a very simple solution. It simply requires you to throw away organic material in an alternate trashcan and is very beneficial for gardening. It is not a very time-consuming solution to implement which is why I think it has a lot of potential as an early change everyone can do to help the environment.
<br><br>
One of the changes that I think is going to be the hardest to implement is flight restrictions. Due to the global impact of the business and political world, flight restrictions would hinder people such as businessmen, popular artists, and political leaders from traveling to do their jobs. In addition, international exportation of goods will be drastically affected, costing businesses a lot of precious time and money. Travelling is also a passion shared by many people (who has ever told you they hated to travel?) so establishing flight regulations will definitely not sit well with the American public. I think this is especially true because the consequences of climate change have not really significantly affected many American lives yet (the time delay effect Ken talked about in previous videos). Furthermore, it will be hard for Americans to truly understand why such a restriction is necessary to help our environment recover.

<br><hr>
I agree. i think that these 20 steps are really helpful and comprehensive ways to get involved in solving the climate crisis. I think that that this classes emphasis on getting involved politically, thru action, and personally through mindfulness, minimalism, and through finding ways that make yourself feel happy and whole was a really new and really effective way of teaching about the climate crisis. It inspired me to take action not just thru guilt tripping as I feel some climate crisis orgs do, but because I really want to make a change and take the suggestions I've been taught. I think appealing to little ways we can make changes through our everyday lives, like cutting out meat for a couple days a week or entirely, biking or taking public transport, prioritizing mindfulness and wellness through interaction as opposed to through material gain, are all things we can incorporate into our lifestyles and are definitely tips I will take with me into my life even after this class is done.

<br><hr>
I agree that the twenty comments were a very beneficial summary of the course, however it was so redundant that I would not show my friends and family this video because they most likely will just fall asleep. The topics were interesting, however he kept tying them together and it felt like I was watching a video on a loop for twenty minutes. I guess repeating yourself multiple times does have a lasting impact because what I got most out of this video was to switch over to a plant- based diet, educate others, buy and waste less and vote. Seemed as if those four main ideas were repeated over and over which in my opinion reduced the effectiveness of the video. Although I feel this way, I did appreciate Ken adding the statistics and percentages behind the problems that we face, it was a helpful recap and it made me realize that I don't actually remember much and that I need to study more often. Instead of showing this video to my friends and family I will just have a one on one conversation with them and talk about the twenty things we can each do to mitigate the climate crisis so that they feel more of a need to pay attention. "Knowledge is power acted upon" and I will use this mentality to open people's eyes and realize what is going on around us and the dangers that we are causing not only for people in disadvantaged areas but also for us.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that the organization of Ken’s lists into 10 personal and 10 collective/political actions is a clear guide for people to follow in order to discover what they can do to diminish their ecological footprint, listed in order of importance. It is necessary for the public to realize that we cannot put our hope in green technology to end the climate change crisis. While green technology has its benefits, the real power is in social, political, and personal change. In Ken’s top 20 impactful changes, not a single objective was met by green technology. Many people are attracted to the idea of green technology as it can be guilty of greenwashing to appear new and advanced. Therefore, people seem more willing to fight the problem through buying “green products” rather than using collective action and change in lifestyle, which seems to be more time-consuming. However, it is suggested through films like Happy and Minimalism, that those who become more involved in collective community action and  attempt to reduce their consumption levels become happier. Thus, this outline that Ken has provided should be within the general’s public knowledge. The best way to do this is to incorporate these 10 changes into our own lives, as well as inform those in our everyday lives.
<br><hr>
I agree with your statement that Ken did a great job in giving us the core ways that we can save our planet. As he listed them one by one, I also thought the background information and examples were a perfect way to reiterate why we must take action. This video made me optimistic as well. As Ken mentioned, none of these actions require technological innovations, which means we can act now. I also believe that it is important to share this video with others!
<br><hr>
I like your comment. As you said, I also consider this video does a great job summarizing the whole course material. I think the solution number 18, sharing what we know so our friends too can have a better understanding of the climate crisis and what can be done, is the easiest way we can contribute to reduce the carbon footprint or save our planet. I also like the sentence that Ken mentioned in a former lecture "The knowledge is only power when acted upon, otherwise knowledge is power squandered". I found it undoubtedly convincible and should be memorized throughout our lives.

<br><hr>
Although I thought it would be repetitive as other videos have been in the past few weeks, it was actually pleasing to see that everything tied together into one video. I agree with you on how he did a great job on recognizing the solutions needed to mitigate the climate crisis, and this would also be the #1 video I would recommend because it has everything you need to know. I really liked how he didn't just name all 20 things at once, but instead grouped them into 3 separate categories: collective, political, and personal. It wasn't hard to understand (like many climate pieces are) and made it enjoyable for everyone to read. By the time everyone finished the video, I for sure said, "It's that easy, huh?" Every week it surprises me that personal actions that are easy, painless, and free have the ability to turn our whole world around, yet nothing is still done. Everyone, including myself, thought that I would have to turn my whole life around in order to save the planet. But it is as easy as taking the bus or eating meat less frequently (I just can't go vegan no matter how hard I try). Everyone thinks that it requires so much hard work, when they can actually start helping their environment in the next couple of seconds. Like Ken said, the biggest action we can take is voting. I voted for the first time this week and it took at the most 5 minutes. If we can't do something this easy, then there is something wrong with our world that needs to change immediately. 
<br><br>

If we all chose to do what is right, we wouldn't be at this point today. A whole entire class full of almost 1,000 people is devoted to understanding how we will meet our ending in the next 10 years... if this doesn't scare anybody, then what will? There is no sense of urgency (only within younger generations) within the people who can actually make the change, i.e. politicians, and it is safe to say that they need to figure it out before it is too late. Like you said, it is only right that aw make these changes because we are the ones who caused it in the first place. All of the solutions Ken presented didn't require special technological advances or even cost money. It is just about living life for the better of yourself and your environment. Although I am optimistic that something will change soon (go Bernie!!!), it will be a long while before the majority are convinced that this is actually real and happening. Everyone needs to see the problem, and they need to make a change now. Before it is too late.
<br><hr>
I completely agree, I thought this video was very well planned out and organized. Similar to you, I like how Ken talked about individual and political/collective action. The video was a good summary of the entire course and ended it on a positive note. While we started the class discussing all the problems caused by climate change, I appreciate ending the class on solutions we can all partake in. Being reminded of data and facts is always important and can prompt change. Being reminded that housing and cars take up ½ of each person’s carbon footprint is shocking. We can all make a better effort to take public transportation and consume less. 
 <br><br>

I also thought it was really important how he talked about political and collective activism. Since not everything can be solved with individual action, it is necessary to note how voting and activism can make a difference. I think we often want to help stop climate change, but don’t know where to start. Ken’s suggestions are helpful reminders that voting, participating in protests, and sharing what we know are all good starts. I definitely agree with you that developed countries must be responsible for fixing this mess. The poorest three billion people have contributed to only 5% of our greenhouse gases, which means that developed countries are responsible for producing massive amounts of CO2, methane, and other harmful gases. We have the responsibility to make a change and not let others suffer because of our mistakes.

I fosho vibe with this comment. For every lecture we learn here in UCSB, there should be some main takeaways even if we forget the rest of it. In the rest of days after taking this class, I hope I can still remember most of these steps we can take by heart. I think this video does a really good job wrapping what we had talked about for steps we can do to mitigate the climate crisis, and these are definitely no strange words. For someone who understands the importance of climate change but doesn’t know how to act upon it, I would definitely introduce this video to them due to its simplicity and comprehensiveness. At the end of the day, these actions boil down to three categories: Political actions, personal actions and cultural changes. Meanwhile, these changes do not solely contribute to stopping Climate Change, it progresses our human races as a whole by advocating for gender equality and greater education opportunities, etc.. These steps are simple, but they require commitment and the “heart” to be put into action. We have to understand the greater picture lying ahead of us, its importance so that it can motivate us to come together at a collective cause.

<br><hr>
Your comment really summed up how I felt about this video. It was such a good cumulative collection of all of the solutions we’ve touched on this quarter. As I was watching this, I realized how much impact this video and this class could really have. Say each one of us simply implements one of these solutions. That is already a huge change. Even bigger if we all make two, or even three, and so on. I also think the best part is as we implement these changes, we communicate and lead by example to the people in our lives and cultivate more action. I am usually fairly pessimistic about change when it comes to the environment because I know people can be stubborn and skeptical, but this video helped me think through a lense of hope and action. 
 <br><br>
I also really agree with you about appreciating the different spheres of action. I thought it was super cool that things I am passionate about such as women's education and reproductive health can be highly beneficial to our planet. This really goes along with the realization that this really isn't a political issue, as at the end of the day it comes down to human rights. Simplified, by helping humans, we help the environment. Another aspect of the climate crisis through a human lens, is many of the things to help the environment help ourselves. Becoming vegan is great for the planet and great for your health. Riding your bike to work improves one’s health with the extra cardio, and reduces emissions. Cutting down on our consumerism can help one live a simpler happier life, and combat the climate crisis. In summary, we help ourselves, we help all humans, and we help the earth. What’s not to like?
<br><hr>
I found this video to be very helpful as well, and I believe the comprehensive list is very straight to the point and concise, as it is crammed into 20 minutes whereas many of the documentaries we watched took over an hour to explain the same concepts. I think that it should be our duty as your students to help spread this message and share this video with friends. I know that I most definitely will be sending this video to friends and family, and will encourage them to share with others, and hopefully adopt some of the objectives proposed in this video. My opinion has definitely changed on the effectiveness of personal action, as prior to this course, and when it was first mentioned, I dismissed personal action as pointless and a waste of time, but now I can see that it can be a very valuable tool used not only to actually reduce carbon emissions, but also to bring around cultural change by making environmental awareness visible to the average person. In addition to this idea in the video lesson, there are a plethora of other great ways to become involved and start making a difference. I challenge myself and everyone watching this to try and attempt at least 5 of the 20 ways to combat climate change, as this shouldn't be too difficult for people, but can lead to huge benefits for our planet.
<br><hr>
I agree that this is a fairly accurate summation for the whole course.  Though I like how it is split into personal and collective actions, I feel as if the collective actions carry more weight.  Furthermore, I believe that several of the collective actions boil down to the same idea, which is to vote.

Many of us voted just a few days ago in the primary.  That is debatably the most important action we could take for the next 6 months.  Though personal changes are helpful and could help mitigate the climate crisis, they are mere drops in the bucket compared to the actions politicians can take.  For example, I remember when Ken said that one politician banning fracking would be as good as the entire country going vegan.  

 <br><br>

I agree that now is the time to act.  If we wait as long as the previous generations have, it will likely be too late to stop catastrophic consequences.  Though science could come in and save the day, it is not a high odds bet and we should not stake the future of our species and planet on the hope that scientists will be able to fix the problems we cause.
<br><hr>

I love your comment! The part that stuck out to me is when you said, "..now is the time to transform our knowledge into power..". After hearing Ken's entire list altogether I think that this is the most important takeaway. If we keep telling people knowledge I power, we will see more knowledge, but no change. The knowledge must be shared taught, spread, interpreted, challenged, etc. It plays into many of the points on his list. In the first 10, education of girls and women as equals to men. And in the second 10, finding 5 friends to explain the importance of voting for climate change, reading and educating ourselves without the bias of big businesses, and finally rethinking the way we live and how our society functions on earth. All of these are great points that require knowledge to be actually used for change and improvement.
 <br><br>
It can also apply to every other number on the list. If the people of the developed world don't have proper knowledge of what's going on with the climate crisis, then there's no way they can make any changes or urge others to change. Another reason this class has the potential to make an enormous impact. Before this class, I had no idea of the climate footprint caused by things like flying or food waste. I also see media about switching to plant-based diets, electric cars, solar panels, or wind turbines. Not only, do I need to so more research, I need to seriously evaluate the media sources before I believe everything that's shoved in my face on twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. As students in this class, now that we have the knowledge it's our duty to make as many personal changes as we can and share this knowledge with as many people as possible in order to jumpstart a movement that will continue to grow and both mitigate climate change and drawdown current greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

<br><hr>
I didn’t even notice that 10 of the actions were personal and the other 10 were collective, that interesting. I agree, Ken did a good job at breaking the actions down and explaining a little more in depth how each would be helpful. I would be recommending this video to friends as well because as I said before he really went in depth with each one of the solutions. 
 <br><br>
I agree with you as well that taking actions begins with one, and that one would be us because we have learned so much throughout this course. Beginning with ourselves we can make a change and then try and communicate with your family members and friends about why they should try and do the same. 
 <br><br>
The idea also related to one another as, they were almost like building on for the next. From the very beginning reducing our food waste to then thinking environmentally and eating more climate conscious meals. Each idea builds up to the next and it shows how connected these things are that doing one might lead you to do the other making it easier to do. We should be the change we want to see, like you said since we are the ones that have caused all these things in the first place. 
 <br><br>
I feel that we could make a change as long as our whole class is engaged. If we all tell our friends and family that's hundreds more people and if they tell their family that's even wider. We just need all this information to be distributed for more people to be conscious of what is happening and what they themselves can do about it.
<br><hr>

I agree with you. Just like the green New Deal provides a roadmap to the government, Ken's lecture video this week made the people understand how to move forward in the future. His list contains comprehensive actions: personal, collective, and political. Some actions are so simple that people can even act immediately if they are willing. Others require long-term efforts, such as educating boys and girls fairly. I really appreciate Ken providing such a list about 20 things people can do to save the planet. Many people around me, including my family, are aware of climate change issues. But most of them can only sigh and feel sad because there is no professional people or organizations to lead them in action. Ken's list is very clear and understandable, and I would love to share it with people I know. In this way they will have clear goals to implement. If more people learn about this list and put it into action, I believe we can save our homes to some extent.


<br><hr>
From the beginning of the course, we learned all about the issues behind the climate crisis, as what caused it-scientifically and politically- to the effects it plays in our natural disasters and up to recently we have been given so many solutions to solving the climate crisis. However, this list of 20 top things we can do, from a range or personal and political, is the best way to end this course. 
 <br><br>
I have definitely learned a lot about the climate crisis and I feel well informed about the issue at hand that I can have a long conversation with someone about the issue, which I will be doing from here on out. I know 20 things might seem like a lot to some people out there, but if you really think about it, you can even combine certain ones and make an actual difference. I mentioned before in previous comments that my diet is changing, and it's changing for the better, I feel a lot healthier and stronger which is perfect for finals. Plus, being a college student I feel like riding a bike or skateboard is just a given, I find having a car completely unnecessary here. And plus there's a student discount on the Amtrak and to be honest its kind of fun being on the Amtrak with a friend. 
 <br><br>
Anyway, you don't have to so ALL 20 things and there's definitely other options, but this is the best summary of the solutions you can do in your personal life. Plus, a lot of them are simple things like Voting. It's honestly just finding the best solution for yourself. If we all do our part, then take the next step and participate in an activist organization, then slowly we can all change our lifestyle.

<br><hr>

I really liked how Ken placed the actions we can take into two categories: personal and collective actions. It gives us a list of things that we can do to lessen our environmental impact on our own. While people always say that personal actions will help a lot, it is not always clear what actions and how much will they help. This list was empowering and gave me a little checklist of actions that I will take to lower my carbon emissions. Also, the list also makes it seem less daunting to make a difference with easy tasks such as decreasing food waste, buying less things, driving less, voting, being informed, and spreading facts about climate change to others. These are all things everyone can do without too much effort and will help the planet and save them money.

<br><hr>
I too think that this is the best video to share with a friend out of all of Kens videos. This video is a great summary of what we have spent the last quarter learning about. Not only is it a great summary but it also goes into detail and provides statistics to put things into perspective. For example, one third of global emissions are tied into our food. production system and half of this is due to our love of meat. 
 <br><br>

Ken really did a great job of tying together the personal, collective, and political aspects that need attention in order to make a difference. The climate crisis absolutely depends on the political aspect as this changing policies has the potential to make the most change. Yes, personal choices can help but the most damage is done by the big companies that continue to frack oil and destroy the planet. It is very essential that we vote and change these policies. If we can combine poetical changes with personal choices we can drastically make a difference. It is also very important that we gain more and more activists for these personal choices. In order for some of these personal choices to be safe and effectively implemented changes need to be made. For example, the bike lanes are unsafe. However, this can be changed if we get large groups of activists that pressure local governments to make the needed changes.
 <br><br>

Lastly, as this class comes to an end I think that climate crisis classes should be made a mandatory GE in all schools, and if not at least in the UC system. As students here we are required to take many classes including ethnicity classes, yet we are not forced to take a class that has so much relevance to our current lives. I took this class because I couldn't get into any other classes and I never would have taken it if not. Im so glad I ended up sticking through it because I learned so much and my eyes have been permanently opened to things that I was blind to before.
<br><hr>
I also found this list extremely helpful as a way to recap all the important events in an organized way that was easy to follow. I think that a lot of people get very overwhelmed when thinking about the climate crisis and feel like there is just too much to be done. By breaking it down into 10 personal actions and 10 political actions, people will know how it is just as important to be politically involved as it is to make personal changes. I think the second 10 tips are extremely important because we can choose to go vegan, travel less, bike more, etc but unless the people in governmental power are working to protect our environment and side against fossil fuel industries, these personal actions just won't be enough. I am also trying to implement all of these tips into my life to further reduce my climate footprint and I think if everyone were to do the same we could make a significant impact on the future of our planet. Whether someone is only doing 2 or 3 things on the last or doing them all, some change is better than none. I also think it is important to differentiate the difference between what the developed world can do versus the developing world. The developed world is responsible for a large majority of emissions and therefore should be the ones responsible for making these changes because we have the money and ability to do so. Like you, I also feel optimistic and hope that people will be awakened towards how much change is really needed. However that awakening needs to happen right now because there is limited time to make the necessary changes.


<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your comment! This video is very helpful for us and for others in understanding what we need to do in order to mitigate the climate crisis. Like you said, these solutions cover many areas of both the personal and the collective side. Not only do these solutions emphasize the way we can deal with the climate crisis, but also the way in which other problems such as social injustices can be mitigated. One of the most important things that we can do, that was highlighted in this video, is to reach out and communicate to others about climate change. Part of what contributes to the issue, is that people do not have the necessary knowledge to take action, including the ways in which they can possibly reduce their carbon footprint. I also believe and agree with you that if there is a video to show to the public, our friends, and family it would be this video. 
 <br><br>

There is no time to waste. As students, we can take this video and present its message to the public. These 20 ways can make a difference, and like you said, we can be the change, a change that starts with ourselves and can inspire others to do the same. When we set the example by taking these steps and taking action, people can see the effectiveness rather than shutting down any hope for change. That is one thing that one person can change. One person can lead toward collective action, that can ultimately change the way the climate crisis is approached.

<br><hr>

I agree that it was informative to separate the list into personal action and then collective and and political action. It’s interesting to look at how people can change the world both in their individual lives and in the large political sphere; the lecture was incredibly helpful in summarizing the course, and shows how individuals can work to help heal the planet and make it better for our future generations. There’s definitely still a very long journey ahead of us, as you point out, but these are good starts. If we can take each of those 20 steps and aim to implement them into our lives or somehow influence the world around us, it’s a good start.


<br><hr>
I really enjoyed this video as well. I found it very informative and concise in how Ken listed what we can do to save the planet. What I liked most about the video is that the solutions presented did not seem very difficult, maybe the hardest one being air travel. However, I felt that this demonstrated the fact that there is so much we can do to mitigate the climate crisis and emphasized the power in which we all hold to create change. Most of the ways in which each of us can do to save the planet also seem to be mostly common knowledge but Ken did an amazing job in showing that these changes in habits due have a large impact on the dying planet. We think that if only one person chooses to live in an environmentally friendly way there is no impact due to the millions of others who decide to not do so. However, if we all do our responsibility as inhabitants of a shared planet, the results can truly be remarkable. I think this comprehensive list was very enjoyable to watch as we are presented with the simple solutions we can all adopt gradually and find other alternatives to shift away from a culture of excess and luxury. Also it showed the amount of focus we have led ourselves to have towards convenience and desire for more and more. I felt that this video greatly summed up what we have learned in this class and brought up again how we do have power to be the change that our planet needs.

<br><hr>
Like you, I believe that Ken was extremely effective, particularly in this video, at listing out what people can do to combat the climate crisis. I really appreciate the fact that he listed out both personal and collective actions, because both are truly necessary to make the difference we need. It was also really amazing to see how many of these things are never even talked about, such as educating girls, and how many of these will actually improve our lives, such as minimalism. If it improves our lives so much in so many ways, we don’t really even have to call it a ‘sacrifice’. As Ken said, it’s a “win, win, win”. 
 <br><br>
 Every single person in this class can begin to take personal action by wasting less, eating as a climatarian, buying less, biking more, etc. but a huge part of our responsibility is communicating problems/solutions so that more people can take action as well. I loved what you said: “with the action of one, more can and will follow”. If one person encourages two more people to change, and those two do the same and so on, we could realistically change culture, which is what needs to happen. Think about how many people would hop on board if being a climatarian was the biggest trend. I always thought it would be cool if we had numbers above our head displaying our carbon footprint (kind of like the “Nosedive” episode of Black Mirror). Think about how many people would care then - too bad we can’t make that happen haha.  However, voting could be arguably just as influential, especially with the upcoming election. It’s crazy to me to think about how much influence the 2020 election will have on the climate crisis and therefore the huge effect it could potentially have on humankind well into the future. The United States has been such a large part of the problem and we need to both take responsibility and lead the way in change, and the only way we can do that is by voting.

<br><hr>
This comment is great because I too believe that If I showed this to my family and friends, they would defiantly understand how much of an impact the climate crisis is towards earth. What I realized was that If I do some of these actions, I will be able to be confident to explain the knowledge of the climate crisis. Once people see you do these actions, they might be open and interested to do it themselves. Also by me showing how happy I am doing good deeds for earth, this could also have people interested. I also agree that everyone could help by just doing one of these actions. The video is not intimidating to anyone because ken is not asking for everyone to do all of these actions. But every little effort counts towards helping the environment will at least leave a little impact. Who knows, if you master one action, you can do others.

<br><hr>
I agree in that these courses of action are an excellent summary of the class and a good way to begin to end the quarter with. It was really informative and encompassed all spheres of influence. It's nice to have a plan laid out for me to follow so that I don't leave this class completely hopeless about the future of the planet. If everyone in developed countries were to follow these guidelines, perhaps we could curtail a lot of the damage being done to the Earth. This would benefit everyone. However, it's still hard to be optimistic when it comes to climate change and the planet's future, as so far very little is being done on a collective and political level to combat it. This is why this outline is so important, because whatever we can do to help, we should, since the issue is so dire and in need of intervention. These outlines should reach everyone in developed countries because the change that would ensure would be huge and for the best.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that the two lists of 10 are essential and helpful for everyone, not just the course but also anyone. I also like Ken’s approaches to describing the 20 personal actions that we can do. Individual action, collective activism, political action, and communications are all connected—both lists aimed at the developed world. Since the poorest 3 billion people on the planet only contribute 5% of greenhouse gasses, the developed should stop producing greenhouse gases and lead by example. Many of us already know, but we need to make it as power with our actions. Some of the activities that we can try to do from today are changing into a mostly plant-based diet, less food waste, education equally on everyone, bike to school, living small-sized house, flying less and buying less, etc. All of these small actions from us can be a significant change. It is not easy to change our daily routine, but we can always change a little day by day. Once you begin, there is more and more progress can be done positively and effectively.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with everything that you had to say. Ken provided us with a great video that perfectly sums up what we have learned in the course and reminds us that now that we have this knowledge, we must put it to use. I also agree with the statement that if you were to recommend any of the videos to a friend, this would be the one. It is fairly dense with information on how we can cut back on our carbon emissions while not dragging out each solution for too long. And even though you may not be able to do everything that Ken says, if you pass the information along to others who are willing to do some of the solutions Ken provided, you would be doing more for the environment than if you would have kept the information to yourself. I am personally trying to do some of these and would strongly encourage others to do the same if they are able to.

<br><hr>
I agree this way a pretty great summary of the course. I think Ken did a really great job with this one. I just like that he gave us actual things to do and ways to go about things now especially with our knowledge of the climate and the problems faced from all ends. This was all understandable and comprehensive as well as just nice to read and apply to our lives.I agree with the point that you made that we should strive to achieve this is other countries and see the changes in other places that just where we are at the moment. That would be awesome if this video took off and thousands of people were watching it and sharing it with other people. Then people could have actual ideas of what to do to make change. I think a problem with other videos and platforms, is the problem of climate change is presented but then its just left there. People get worried, scared  and hopeless. With this list of things to do, people will actually be able to make their own change. it wont be an easy or fast process but we can do it with enough support.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that this video was laid out very comprehensively. I like how the two lists of ten Ken presented dealt with personal action and collective/political action respectively. It was a great way to summarize all of the findings of the course. Not only did Ken provide a lot of details that are important in learning how to combat the climate crisis, but he also explained them in a way that was very easy to understand. Watching this video made it immediately obvious what someone who wants to fight the climate crisis should do.
 <br><br>


I also agree that privileged people in developed countries should immediately start taking these steps. Developed nations disproportionately contribute to this crisis that will affect everyone on Earth, especially hurting those in poorer. The people living in these nations thus have a responsibility to act and do what they can to try to stop the consequences of their actions. If enough privileged people take the steps stated in this video, we could make a big positive difference in the world.

 <br><br>

Before taking this course, I was very worried about the climate crisis and had no idea how I was supposed to fight it. I thought that I could recycle, use LED lights, and bike to school and that would make everything okay. I know many of my friends and family think the same way. Unfortunately, while those actions are certainly helpful, they are not enough on their own. This video makes it very clear why, and also explains everything that people should be doing if they truly care about fighting the climate crisis. I want to show this video to the people I know, and I hope more people watch this video and learn what their next steps should be.

<br><hr>
I also really loved the layout in which Ken presented the 20 summarized solutions for how to help the Earth. I think it was clever to divide the list equally between personal versus political actions. It allows those who are newer to the climate crisis issue to ease their way in through small, (or large), personal choices or modifications, while people who may be much more familiar with the cause can feel emboldened to try new strategies on raising awareness for the issue on a larger platform. It lets people feel like they can approach the cause from any and all angles, and that regardless of what it is they choose to pursue, they will be doing SOMETHING to help the Earth.
 <br><br>

I definitely also believe that it's a great summarization of the course as a whole. This entire quarter, Ken has always stressed that helping mitigate the effects of climate change will not be fixed completely by our individual actions; as nice as that would be, it will always require larger figureheads to really make noticeable and substantial change. However, individual actions still play huge roles in gaining the interest of important leaders towards the issue, so I like that Ken provided the most talked about and widely-manageable solutions from both the political and personal spectrums of the climate crisis. It really creates a solid and concise wrap-up to the content provided through the entirety of the course.
<br><hr>


I agree when you say that these 20 items that Ken lists out are good summary to this course. In his list of 20 items,there are 10 personal actions and 10 collective actions on how to save the planet, and the actions he lists out are actions that he explained more in depth with previous lectures.  I also agree with you and Ken that if there is one video to refer a friend or family to, it would be this one, because I feel like this lecture effectively sums everything we learned for the past 9 weeks... it condenses weeks of content into a 24 minute video by listing the main ideas of each lecture, and gives out information everyone should know in order to be educated about the climate crisis. The general public remains uneducated of the climate crisis and how politics tie with climate change, however if they watch this video, they will become informed and therefore be able to take action against climate change, which is why I believe that this video should be shared to the public in general.

 <br><br>

This class has changed my way of thinking for many things. I will continue to try to eat less meat and waste less stuff even after this class ends, this will be my own contribution to the fight against climate change.



<br><hr>

What a fantastic summary on behalf of Ken to finish this course off with a bang! I feel confident and hopeful and ready to get to work. I want to make change happen and have the satisfaction of crossing off these 20 items on a list, knowing I am doing good to the earth. I want to raise kids that have this mindset in place from early childhood of the desperate level of care that the earth requires for us to live a healthy life. I want to have kids that encourage their circles to also partake in eco-conscious decisions. I can only do my best in leading by example and sharing the knowledge that I have gained from this class. 
 <br><br>
Although I took this course as a general education requirement, I am pleased with my choice, as it relates to my major, Environmental Studies, in more ways than I thought. I want to make personal changes that radiate in the communities around me. I want to be the direct line of motivation that moves someone to live a minimalistic lifestyle. There are so many conversations that I want to have with family members back at home who are very conservative and "anti-vegan," if you will. I want to pick with their brains for a bit to get their take on climate change and see what they have to say about the knowledge that I have gained from this class  I really am impressed with the people that are taking this class purely to be informed on the topic.
<br><hr>

Let's make this video go viral! I totally agree that this does a great job of summing up the lessons of this course, and in an uplifting, go-and-do-it kind of way. The list is understandable, not overwhelming and well-divided into two types of actions. I will say I wish there was more emphasis in this course on numbers 3 and 4. When the topic of women's bodies and education becomes an environmental issue as well, why is there not more of a combined effort to address the issues as connected? After all, half this class is women and everyone, regardless of gender, should know and love at least one woman enough to want decent rights for women (bit of a stretch, I know, but I'm hopeful). This is easily the largest demographic of people to get behind making a collective environmental change. 
 <br><br>

After #3 and 4, I think that the most underrated yet powerful actions to take is 14: protesting and civil disobedience. Greta Thunberg is proof that peaceful protest can have immense results. But first, people need to get educated enough to get angry. And that's where I think this video can come in and introduce a wide overview of the issue to the general public.


<br><hr>


I agree with you that Ken did a great job at summarizing what we have learned this quarter into the one list of twenty or the two comprehensive list of ten things that we can as individuals do to combat the climate crisis. The first ten things are a list of personal actions, and the latter ten are collective and political action things that we can do in our individual lives in order to lower our carbon emissions. I also agree with you as well as Ken that I would recommend this video the most to friends because it clearly encompasses everything from personal, collective and political actions that not only the people in the United States should try to do but everybody else in the developed world. I too have tried to implement a number of these things in my life because I feel like the issue of the climate crisis is the most important long term issue for my generation and the ones after me as well. I know many people might feel like doing some personal or collective action will not be that important on a large scale, but it is. If we can START as individuals to change our culture and start acting differently we can make big changes to help the climate crisis. Notice earlier I cap that word ‘start’ because yes personal action is a start but, of course, that is not where it ends I have, as well as Ken, has said that it will be a combination of many things that will ‘save’ us in this crisis. I hope out of all of Ken’s videos this one is shared widely because everyone needs to know that we can make individual changes and start grassroots efforts to take our future into our hands and save this planet for all species currently living on it and all the future generations of species still to come. In my eyes, humans are being very selfish creatures because we rather hurt our planet now instead of helping it. I agree with you that if enough people make these changes then it is a step closer to changing the outcome of Anthropogenic climate change. With that, all said and done I too feel optimistic that the human race can make the necessary changes to save the future of our planet.

<br><hr>
I’m grateful to have this video, and the list of 20 actions to take that it contains, as this class comes to an end. The reality is that the solution to climate change is huge and complex. I didn’t expect to learn so much so quickly, but I feel like this class could’ve been twice as long as still wouldn’t be able to go as in-depth as possible when considering all of the individual issues that the climate crisis presents. My brain has been bombarded with information that I sincerely want to remember and continue living by when this class ends, hopefully throughout the rest of my life, and this summary helps to summarize everything we’ve talked about very succinctly. 
 <br><br>
As you also noted, I appreciated that this list encompassed multiple types of action - being personal, collective, and political. I’ve certainly been moved to start implementing some of the personal changes into my life, such as a less wasteful diet and alternative transportation, but this class has also started a fire in my heart that makes me want to become more politically active in the fight against the climate crisis as well. Thank you Ken, for teaching such an informative and eye-opening course! Of all the classes I’ve taken at UCSB, I feel like English 23 is one that I will remember and will appreciate taking the most.

<br><hr>


 thank you for calling it to my attention that the list of 20 was evenly split between 10 personal actions vs. 10 collective actions. Like you and others have mentioned, Ken has indeed done a fantastic job in his presentation of course material. He never once sounded alarmist, but continuously offered solutions from small to large scale that any could implement. Too many times I have seen climate change activists spread word, yet offer little to no solution, and the offered solution is something that not everyone could implement due to financial, geological or any situational restriction. However, Ken offers multiple solutions that take into account a number of circumstances, so that every individual could adopt at least one. This class has urged me to be more environmentally conscious not only on a personal level, but also in doing my part to facilitate this same mindset in others. I was lucky to take ENG122EA with Ken in which the environmental issues were looked at from a more functional perspective in which we dissected more thoroughly the roots of environmental distress, from coal & petroleum industries to fast fashion and housing. Both classes have helped me gain a new hope in that so many people feel the same way and are active in doing what they can to relieve this planet of the harm that it is going through. These solutions, if really employed as individuals and community would be a step towards a better future for us and our planet.

<p>

It’s really helpful to have this list of solutions! I like the approach that this class took, as represented by the course title: first describing what the climate crisis is, and then what we can do about it. Though I found the first part of this course very disheartening, the second half gave me hope that we can actually fix these problems, if we act quickly enough.
 <br><br>


Many of the changes Ken laid out are not hard to adopt and will actually save people time and money. Others, like voting, are comparatively small actions that can have a very big impact. Simply by deciding not to fly or by cutting meat out of their diets, people can drastically decrease their carbon footprint. I found these solutions really inspiring, and after taking this course I definitely have a greater idea of what I can do on a personal level to help solve this global crisis. The world is at a critical stage: if we don’t change our course, we’ll soon be past the point of no return, or the “tipping point.” I truly believe that we have the ability, as individuals, as a country, and as a planet, to resolve the climate crisis, but it will take a lot of work and a lot of convincing of those who are not yet on board.

I absolutely loved this video! I have to say this was my favorite video of the quarter. It was simple, clear and got straight to the point and really is a great way to wrap up this class. A lot of these solutions are very simple and are a great start to stopping the climate crisis. Since I already don't eat red meat, I will continue that and also try to eat more plant based/freegan when appropriate. I am hoping that in the coming years, I can start using a bike more frequently to travel around town and practice more minimalism in my daily life. This lecture video was incredbily  perfect to really get all the ideas from the entire quarter of information we learned into one simple video that can be easily grasped. I can't wait to see what I can do in the future to limit my carbon emissions. Together, we can save the planet with these twenty simple techniques. THANK YOU KEN!

I love how Professor Ken included all the solutions in this video for anyone to view. It gives people so many options on how to take action and shows that there should be no excuse for them not to. I think that in order to truly make a difference we must combine many of these actions and be constantly doing them all together. The Climate Crisis is such a complex issue that it requires effort from everyone and requires all of the solutions that were mentioned in the lecture video to be done. If all of us were to combine many of these solutions we could hopefully find the true solution to this serious problem. I enjoy this quote from Thea Bowman that states, “Sometimes people think they have to do a big thing in order to make a change. But if each one would light a candle we’d have a tremendous light”. In order for there to be a real change, we all must do our part in small ways. 
 <br><br>

I will definitely share what I've learned from this lecture video and this class in general with all of my friends and family who aren't as informed or don't fully understand this topic. This issue can seem difficult to many and that's because it is a tough pill to swallow. The crisis comes with so many consequences and is derived from various sources that we must continue to understand fully. I thank Ken for informing so many people through his lectures, readings, and films he’s shared with us throughout this class, I greatly appreciate it.

When I first saw that this video was 24 minutes, I was a little turned off by the idea of sitting and listening to that long of a lecute, but honestly, after watching it, I wished it was longer. I feel like it is easy to say things like “lets help combat climate change” and “ we need to deal with this problem” but no one gives examples on how to accomplish our goals. It is very important that we have actual examples of the things we can do to fight climate change rather than just throwing around empty promises and words. I feel as if I have left this class with so much greater knowledge on the things that I can do to help combat climate change. I feel like I have a bigger purpose in life now than before I started this course. I am excited to continue my life with the knowledge that I have gained from this course, and the 20 points that were mentioned on this video. It is mind boggling to me how many of these things that people are not aware of and just how bad some things are for the environment. I’m one to say this because I didn’t know half the things that could help combat climate change before taking this course. I will continue life with these 20 summarizing points in mind and will go through life informing people on these points.

Ken’s lecture video this weekend was a culmination of everything we have learned in this class so far. While I was already familiar with most of the topics and statistics mentioned throughout the video, I was still engaged and found the video as a good recap for the whole series. Ken is right when he states that this video is probably the best one to link to your friends and families if you were interested in introducing them to the climate crisis. Usually when I introduce the climate crisis to someone, their first question is “how can we fix this problem?” Before this class that was also my first question. This video lists 20 reasons, 10 personal and 10 collective actions that anyone can start exercising right after the video ends. That is more than enough for an individual to get started and there should not be any more excuses. I am still surprised that housing and transportation takes up ½ of an average American’s footprint. Upon learning this statistics, I am more curious about what the average footprint for people from all around the world is like. Although this course is mainly focused on American and the emissions happening here in our nations,  I am also interested in seeing the climate crisis in a much broader perspective. The world is a big place and I am sure that there are nations in very different circumstances than the United States. I grew up in a suburb all my life and never considered the effects it had on the climate crisis. I will definitely be taking Ken's advice and telling my friends and family back home about my newly gained knowledge from this quarter. I also agree that we all need to focus on buying less stuff. I feel like tracking your purchases is a good way of keeping yourself in check. If you write down everything you buy when you decide to buy it, it can give you a clear picture of how much you are buying and whether or not you really need the items that you are buying. Without it a good visual representation of one’s spending, it is very easy to just buy more and more. Finally, for personal action, I also believe that education is very important and I am still disappointed that free and fair education is not provided for all men and women in the United States. We have the resources and we must use it to educate people now before it is too late.
 <br><br>
In the case of collective action, I love how Ken states that voting is the most important and effective method to tackle the climate crisis. Another common excuse that people give is that they’re simply “too busy” to become an activist or dedicate their time to slow travel. Now that I know the importance of voting, I can use this tactic as a way to stir my friends and family to action because like Ken says, “who doesn’t have 1-2 hours in a year to vote?” There should be no excuses. I also found the emphasis on community and relationships to be great advice for those who are just starting out as climatarians. I think having emotional and physical support from the people around you is a great motivator and will lead to faster and more impactful changes in our society’s culture. If more and more people openly accept the existence of the climate crisis and act in ways that help mitigate the crisis, then it will attract people to do the same. Sharing encouragement is an effective way to stir up change because people are often scared to be judged or outcasted for doing something against social norms by themselves. Finally, I thought Ken’s advice that we need to act ourselves is very good advice. If we just talk the talk, but our actions are different from what we preach, then everything is meaningless. This can also have a negative effect on the public’s perception of climate activists. If you claim to be an environmentalist then you must be an environmentalist. Ken gives the example that if you know flying is bad and continue to fly then you are not helping anyone.

I agree, this video does an excellent job of accumulating all of the important topics and actions we have discussed this quarter in regards to helping the climate. Like you, I found myself thinking throughout the video that these suggestions apply so closely to my life as an American. Although I'm curious about how other countries contribute to the climate crisis, I ultimately realized that Americans are the one's who need these suggestions the most as we are one of the main contributors, contributing about one fourth of the global greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, I also found that the first 10 personal actions were the most inspiring to me. I think the reason for this is that these are personal actions that can be swiftly implemented and attempted without much resistance. It's truly astonishing and rather disgusting how much common American practices such as driving and living in a large house negatively affect the earth. Ultimately, this video serves as a great introduction to show somebody who is curious about their climate impact and how they can act to improve their relationship to the environment.

I agree with all of your statements. This video is an amazing recap of all the things we can do to help the environment and reduce our CO2 emissions. I think that if any of Ken’s videos were to become trending on Youtube, this video would be the best one because it answers the question most people have about climate change which is, as you stated, “How can we fix this problem?” This video has 20 solutions to help and honestly, if everyone were to use five of these solutions in their own lives, we would be making a huge first step toward a better future. I personally believe that voting, cutting down flights, and cutting down meat consumption are the three easiest things that everyone can do as their own first steps. As Ken has stated multiple times throughout the quarter, it takes 1-2 hours every year to cast a vote for people and bills that can help shut these bigger companies’ consumption of fossil fuel and carbon down. For cutting down flights, most people who are traveling by airplane are not necessarily doing it our of necessity (except for our international students whose home is across an ocean.) Even if we cut one plane ride out of five that we take that can be a great difference because that means that if 300 more people do the same, we can get one flight canceled. Lastly, with cutting down meat consumption, we all can have one vegetarian day each week to help do so. Additionally, we can all shift away from beef by switching over to turkey burgers or chicken tacos which would decrease the CO2 of our meat consumption by about 80%. With any of these solutions, having a large following behind it would help decrease the gas emissions greatly. A great thing that you stated was that “ Sharing encouragement is an effective way to stir up change because people are often scared to be judged or outcasted for doing something against social norms by themselves.” I agree with this full-heartedly because I too feel the pressure sometimes to give in to societal norms even if the outcomes are bad. For example, my family is made up of huge meat eaters, especially beef, and whenever I come home and want something other than meat they make fun of me or complain that I am being picky. This kind of shaming for wanting to do something good is the worst and I know that if the US as a whole saw plant-based diets as more acceptable, then more people would be willing to make the change for themselves and the environment. That should be our very first step, changing the stigma behind all of our bad habits so that we can make a swifter change.

<br><hr>
This video was a really concise and orderly recap of the whole course so far. It was informative and short, qualities that help people stick around and hear the whole message. I agree with the notion that if we were to share one video from this course, then this video would be it. It includes everything important about the course as well as the most impactful statistics and recommendations about lifestyle changes. I also agree with you about how you appreciate that Ken mentions the importance of voting. The action that can make the most difference is the one that only takes an hour a year to do. All of these tips that Ken mentions are a good reminder to be conscious of every action of our everyday lives. I hope that this video, as well as the videos in this course can help spread the word about the environment and cause people to act. The social climate of today has become more accepting of the fact that climate change is real, and thus, now would be a good time for the videos in this course to blow up.

<br><hr>
Ken's lecture sums up the whole second half of the class in one video. Still getting important facts like what aspects of my life to fix a client up at the most and specifics with your mouth will take a chance that we have met. I misunderstood the part about buying items., It seems to me that everything that affects the climate is obtained by us why is only 25% of climate change/climate footprint affected by Things we buy. Wouldn't it be everything? I also think that we will become happier if we stop buying as much stuff as I went over in the documentary happy. This inherently deals with minimalism, materialism, consumerism, capitalism, and many other things. I suppose everyone should watch this bird video if you are in the choir class at UCSB, but especially if you are just a normal part of society because this is one of the best overviews that you can get in 24 minutes. This video is an entrance into understanding how our climate footprint is made up.

<br><hr>
I agree that this video was a great summation of what action we should take towards mitigating the climate crisis. At the beginning of this class, I was worried I would be left with a ton of pessimism and some vague, broad answers/solutions. However, this video was a good reminder that we have been well equipped with the knowledge that we can begin to take personal action towards the issue. Even something as simple as maintaining your interpersonal relationships and being a decent human being is part of the solution. It's about realizing that we have been conditioned to see the environment in a way that allows us to wreak havoc, and how our knowledge of that conditioning can be reversed and improved upon. It's realizing that we've been manipulated into blindly accepting a consumer culture that kills our planet and our relationships to other people and ourselves. Now that we have this knowledge, the least we can do is vote and share what we know with others.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. I think this video does a really good job of summarizing what we have learnt in the past lectures. This video gives plenty of ways for us to initiate to help with the climate crisis. However, the 20 personal and collective solutions are mainly targeted toward American lifestyles. There are other countries in the world trying to do something about the climate crisis as well and some of the solutions might not suit their situation. 
<br><br>
When Ken said that despite the fact that he makes weekly videos, talking is cheap, I completely agree. If we don't act upon the knowledge that we have, we may as well don't have the knowledge. The 20 solutions that Ken listed are clearly all doable and there is no reason why we shouldn't give them a try.
<br><hr>

I agree with many of your conclusions regarding the lecture video, especially resonating with the Ken's emphasis on acting upon the information being given ourselves rather than only spreading it around without personal action. Persistent inaction while knowing the detrimental effects of said action is even worse than just plain ignorance, it may not be purposeful, but it's not like the environment can tell the difference. It is disappointing and frankly selfish that with the sheer amount of resources and warnings regarding the climate crisis, the world still refuses to change in order to halt the crisis. I guess that goes to show the amount of influence climate change denial and decades of inaction has had on the general public when it comes to facing the truth about the climate crisis. I'm glad that this video was made as it serves as a succinct overview of what exactly is needed by each person if this planet is going to be saved from ourselves. Individualism and independence are great and all, but if the world is to be saved, personal and collective action is needed, change is best achieved when people take responsibility and work together. I hope that with climate change informational resources, like Climate Crisis 101, and the various other sources of information coming out, that everyone will realize that we must walk the walk.

I really enjoyed this week’s lecture video; I think it was an excellent lecture to conclude our class with. It perfectly summed up everything we learned in this class this quarter in a short and easy to understand way. He makes sure to restate the most important lessons he has taught us including all the steps we can take to live a more environmentally sustainable life. I loved how Professor Hiltner split up his 20 things we can do to about the climate crisis, 10 being focused on individual actions we can take, and the other 10 being political and collective actions because as we learned earlier this quarter we need all three of these types of actions in order to get environmental change. I think an important thing to note is how fixing our climate crisis is not a quick and easy fix, it requires multiple long-term changes and if we want it to make major impacts than big corporations need to also follow these steps. One of my favorite terms I learned this quarter (one Professor Hiltner is unsure will catch on, I hope it does) is Climatarian. I think this is a game changing word and practice because it is less limiting for those who cannot commit to being vegetarian or vegan, while still letting it know that they care about the environment. Being a climatarian allows you to feel good knowing you’re doing your best to reduce your carbon footprint while also teaching those around you there are simple things we can do like getting a chicken burger instead of beef. Another thing I enjoyed learning about was this week’s subject, happiness. I loved seeing other countries like Denmark and how their citizens are so happy, content with life, and healthy all because they take mental health seriously as well as not indulging themselves in materialistic objects. It is inspiring to see how so many people around the world are happier living a life that meets their basic needs and that’s it. I thought the co-housing concept was not only very environmentally friendly especially sense that house had 20 families in it, but it was also very interesting how communities like that exist. Each family has to cook one or two meals a month leaving all that extra time to themselves and spending quality time with one another. I also find that sharing a space like is very similar to be a very friendly neighborhood, only difference is your neighbor is right next to you! It honestly reminds me of living in dorms, our friends are next door and we are all in the same building. Overall I really enjoyed this class and I feel like I have learned so much that I can now pass on to my friends and family.

I really enjoyed your comment especially when you talked about how if we want to fix our climate it won’t be a quick fix. I think we all get so caught up in the data and the overwhelming information that we forget we need to implement these solutions right now so that they have time to work. We’ve talked about how even if we stopped emitting carbon today it would still be affecting our earth for hundreds of years. So we need quick action and the 20 ideas that Ken gave us are the way to fix this climate change problem. The 10 solutions that individuals can take right now seem relatively easy as well as the 10 solutions that we need collective action for. This lecture in particular is important for everyone to watch because it incorporates everything that we can do and everything we need to do. I also liked your comment about how you personally enjoyed the term Climatarian because I as well found this term intriguing whenever Ken talked about it. I know having discussions with people that are climate deniers is difficult but I think terms like this are a way to open a discussion.
<br><hr>
Your comment perfectly captures the take away that I too have gained from taking this course. Along with students like you, I am so grateful for the insight that Ken has shared over the past few weeks in ways we can mitigate the climate crisis through our own actions. You mention Ken’s introduction of the word “climatarian.” I also loved this word because it encompasses a general recognition that all choices affect our planet substantially, from personal decisions to environmental policies to societal equity; there is no person that will be left unaffected. If there was one concept that I will always remember from this class when considering environmental issues, it will be that a systemic change that turns the American lifestyle around will be the most effective way to address the climate crisis. The way that Ken structured this lecture to summarize the key points from this class makes it easier for me to go back consistently in the future and check the steps our country and myself have taken to make a difference. Most importantly, I can easily share what I have learned from this class with family and friends, just as you state.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your comment! This lecture perfectly encapsulates everything that we have been learning and talking about in this class this quarter. This lecture clearly lays out all of the issues that have been discussed and the possible solutions and actions that each individual can take on a personal and more collaborative level. The film we had to watch about happiness also allowed me to get a better perspective as to what we value as a society. There is a much larger emphasis here in the United States to work harder in order to achieve success, but there are many cases where people simply end up burning out. In countries like Denmark, where citizens put a larger emphasis on being happy, they work less and are able to enjoy their lives more. It seems like there needs to be a large cultural change in order to achieve a sort of society similar to that of Denmark, where people place a larger emphasis on doing things that make them happy and less time working.

I agree, the video does well in summarizing the overall message of this class, and includes highlights and refreshers of what you can do to combat climate crisis. The video shows that there are two main parts to curbing this problem : personal and political action. This course introduced me to many things I already knew, and many things I didn't know. The useful information provided by this class goes to show that education is indeed one of the most important ways we can contribute to slowing down climate crisis. The video shows points covering what to do for personal CO2 emissions, political policies, and climate change deniers/ and/or those that are ignorant of the situation.

Additionally I wanted to touch upon “stuff”. This is probably the activism choice I am least inclined to participate in for a number of reasons. Put simply--I like to work hard to earn money and then spend it on things that I need/want/ or just like. I am privileged enough to have most of my college related finances covered so the money I work for is just for my own pleasure. Recently I have saved up for some clothes from lululemon, bikinis from midori, as well as some new jeans. These are all things I did not necessarily need but it definitely gave me a sense of happiness and fulfillment when I was able to make those purchases on my own. Honestly I’ve grown up this way, my parents have always provided me with everything I needed but I liked earning and saving until I could make big purchases on my own. Minimalism and tiny houses--and getting rid of lots of “stuff” really seems difficult for me personally. This is definitely something I want to work on and learn to become more satisfied with the things I already own but I wanted to be vulnerable and honest about this topic because I know I fall short by a long shot here in regards to helping the climate crisis.

I loved this week’s lecture because it was an overview of the twenty things that must be done in order to fight the current climate crisis. I loved how the list was split up into two parts, half things that we can do individually and the other half being things that is politically focused. Some of the points made stood out to me in particular. The first point that stood out to me was point number two: “at meals, when we eat for the good of the planet and its climate.” This was one of the personal suggestions that I need to work on the most. Whenever I eat, only recently have I been more conscientious when I pick out what I choose to consume. Another point that stood out to me was point number thirteen: “prior to the polling place, as we explain to five or more of our friends and family the importance of voting on behalf of our planet, it’s climate, and all the life that lives on it.” Not only is it crucial to vote if possible, but it is also necessary to encourage as many people that we know to vote because of the fact that every vote matters.

Ken, I really liked this whole video.  It was great to have all the 'most important' parts of this course in one 25 minute clip. Great study tool so thanks.  I do have just one small issue with the video that I'm going to make this comment to you about.  I hope not to be nitpicky but I had an issue at the beginning of the video when you insinuated that although it would be great if everyone could attain a plant based diet, that its okay because we know that these emission are being dwarfed by the emission put out by fracking, and also noting that CO2 is far more destructive in the atmosphere than methane is.  I do not dispute these claims at all.  I just feel it is a dangerous pitfall categorizing these polluting behaviors as more or less bad than each other.  We need to be cognizant as a society that all of our shortcomings are equally as poisonous  to our potential at growth or planetary salvation.  Every dangerous practice is inherently linked to the other. Meat production could never be just the amount of methane that cows put into the air.  It is every human who drives to a factory to slaughter animals or pack their flesh in plastic, it's every tree chopped down and the oxygen lost to clear way for the pasture, its every drop of plastic that comes from tar sands and goes into the bulldozers that pave strip malls that prepare for massive super markets.  Everything we do that promotes our irresponsibly self centered lives is an issue that is tied to every other issue.  I guess its hard not to sound like an anarchist but it seems like when you break it down like that that the whole system needs to be thrown away.  I wonder if thats even possible.  I'm sorry if i misinterpreted anything you said, and I know you weren't belittling the importance of eating climate consciously obviously, I guess I was playing devils advocate a bit.

The 20 things we can do for the environment includes ten of individual actions and ten of political and collective actions. This shows a optimistic future about our planet, because there are lots of scientists even common people are trying their best to protect it. It we just keep doing one item of these 20 things, we also can make some difference. The twenty means to protect our environment cover most our class content. I would like to implement it in my personal life. Since i take the class, I have began to be a vegan and reducing times of travel. I also appeal my friends to do the same things. Our generation is flexible to adapt changes, so I have confidence to slow down the climate change by out efforts.

I think this video has included everything after the midterm. I like this video because it serves like a review for us and can help us remember most of the things we have learned. It shows 20 solutions and ways that can reduce our emission and save our planet. This lecture is just like project drawdown, but it is more comprehensive and clear. Ken gives lots of effective and direct methods to address climate crisis. With all the information Ken provides, I am pretty confident to change my current habits to more environmental friendly ones and can also inform other people the current situation we are facing and how to adjust it.

Ken, I am so glad you made this video! For many of us, this acts as a review which is great but this is a perfect video to share with others that are not in the class and haven't watched all of your other lectures. I have family and friends that ask me about this class and this would be a great way for me to communicate what I have learned and hopefully help them learn about what they can do. I also think this video provides hope and shows that we can really make these changes and we can have an impact. Overall, I found this lecture to be a big encouragement to continue to fight for change, continue to educate others, continue to educate ourselves, and continue to act and act more. It's our time to fight for our futures, it doesn't end when this class ends, this was just the beginning.

I  completely agree this video is a great and easily accessible source to send to family and friends to get them informed about the climate crisis and how to modify their lifestyles to help lessen our effects on climate change and helps us do our part of spreading the knowledge! With all of the points he listed I feel that it all boils down to number 20: being the change you want to see in the world. By having healthier eating habits, traveling in more fuel efficient methods, and simply voting, the population can make the changes needed to form a greener lifestyle in our country as a whole. Simply making the right decision of being more environmental can have all the impact in the long run. What's also great is that pretty much all of these points that he mentioned are beneficial to ourselves too. For example, eating a plant based diet will translate to having a healthier body and lifestyle, practicing the lifestyle of minimalism can be freeing as you no longer will have tons of items to worry about giving you a more peaceful mind and saving you money as you no longer are wasting money on useless items to begin with. Using more environmentally forms of transportation like biking everywhere will allow you to have a much more relaxed commute, freeing your mind from hectic everyday traffic and allow you to see things in your community that you may have never seen before. Thus all providing you the ability to feel happiness, thus making this list a perfect way to persuade others to join the movement of taking action against climate change as well as living healthier happier lives.

Amazing content.
<br><br>

I will definitely send this video to friends who are interested in climate change and my actions. 
<br><br>

This sums up the class and shows how climate crisis is not just a science issue. It's a cultural issue and requires not technological solutions, but also political, social, and cultural. For the personal actions, Ken emphasizes that it's not technology we need. I think many people would be surprised to learn that diet and foodwaste has a larger impact than global solar panels. "climatarian" wouldn't have the baggage of "vegan". 1/3 global greenhouse gas is from food, but 2/3 of food is wasted, even before it makes it to the consumers. That waste doesn't "go away," it goes to a landfill. Ken's population solution is a win/win/win, and it shows that fighting climate change isn't just the environment, it's the people too. 45% unintended pregnancies in the US leads to more CO2e. It's not looking to other countries like Africa and blaming them, etc (since the average american emits about 20x the average african). It's offering solutions and just saying that we should let women have access to education and allow them to be in control of their bodies. As for cars, Ken says use them less. It's not getting a tesla which would emit as much as 100 electric bikes during production. Even a normal car's inherent cost, from its production, would blow your carbon allotment for a lifetime. Housing takes care of stuff and energy use. Larger house= more stuff+ more heating. It might mean more driving too, if you're living in suburbia. Ken also brings up planes, which even though 19/20 people in the world don't fly, and it only accounts for 2% of the GHG emission globally, the people who are privileged enough to fly are more responsible. They should make whatever changes they can for the people who aren't privileged enough to do so. To sum up, 1/2 average american emission is from food+foodwaste;1/4 is from stuff; and 1/2 is from cars+homes. 

<br><br>

Then Ken goes on to address political and cultural solutions. Vote (28% CH4(g) is from beef, but more is from fracking). Spread info to 5 or more people, do gatherings+protest.

This is the video that I can show to my parents and friends. Thank you Ken. 

<br><br>

Even if they just do the simplest acts on the list, which in my opinion are buying from environmentally-fair companies and voting for people and initiatives, they have reduced the footprint, though if they can do slow travel and limit planes, their footprint gets chopped hugely. I love that some of the items on the list essentially just say to "follow through." For example 17-20 all just say 'join groups, think harder, and implement the change,' I love how intentional this list becomes through Ken's language there. Ken's not simply saying some possible changes that could help, he's saying that we need to change now. 

<br><br>

Using contraception could be a tip easily replaced with "have less children" or even "adopt." If you adopt a child and give him/her/them a happy, minimalist life filled with joy and not driven by material possession, you have given them the biggest gift of their life. 
<br><br>


The easiest changes I can make are to my diet and food waste, as well as using biking and walking and public transport, the hardest change I will ever face is that of living in a smaller house or community living. I love having space and alone time, and the thought of trying to inhabit a small space filled with other people is not that appealing to my 6'6" self.

<p>
This lecture I thought was really informative and helpful. For instance I didn’t know or maybe forgot that fracking is now more harmful to the planet than the beef industry. That’s rather unsettling to me. Also by switching to a plant based diet we’d reduce 137 gigatons of CO2 being put into the atmosphere each year. And that switching to electric vehicles would only reduce 10% of that amount of CO2. Furthermore the carbon released by producing cars is an insane amount. Ken says that if we only purchased a new car every 11 years but didn’t drive it once, that would account for our entire CO2 allotment for our lifetimes. That really puts into perspective how much harm we can have on the planet by simply buying something only 5-6 times in our lives. 
<br><br>
But overall I love this lecture because it gives so many suggestions as to how to help reduce our effect on climate change. Be it from changing our diet, the way we travel, voting, etc. I know I’ve said it before but it makes it so much more palatable to see that just by changing one or two things, it can make a huge difference. Obviously we need to do most if not all of these suggestions if we are really trying to lower our carbon footprint to the max. But we can start small and work our way up week by week and year by year. And to me, that’s a great way to communicate this issue to the masses. I think by telling people to try changing these things one at a time instead of all at once is much more likely to have an effect on people that think there’s little to nothing they can do to help stop climate change. Well done and well said, Ken!

I want to give a shoutout to a friend of mine who goes to Claremont Mckenna--Eric Warmoth. He is probably doing 10x more for the climate than anyone else I know (maybe besides Ken). Eric is not only a climatarian and chooses to eat in favor of the climate, but also is a huge proponent of the “joining initiatives to support each other, spreading the word to others, and “walking the talk”. Eric blasts lots of stuff on his social media encouraging others to vote for candidates that support sweeping climate change--he even matched donations that his friends would make to donate towards candidates he supports. Additionally, he pointed me in the right direction for candidates I could support here in Santa Barbara that also reflect sweeping climate change ideals. Overall I think the planet could use a lot more humans like Eric and we would definitely be on a path towards a healthier, greener planet for all.

Wow can’t believe we’ve made it through to the end of week nine. I can confidently say I learned a lot with the videos Ken’s filmed for us, the documentaries he’s had us watch and even the articles he had us read. I’m not that big of a reader and I got through the whole course material so that’s saying a lot. I’ve changed a handful of things that I used to do in my day to day life, like cut down on the amount of beef I consumed, and I will slowly but surely cut down the amount of days of the week I eat it, the goal it to cut it out as much as possible. I make sure that when it comes to whatever I buy that it is most defiantly a necessity and not just another thing to add to the things I never use, and ever since I moved here to Santa Barbara I’m always either commuting by bike or by bus but I’ve also practiced this at home and tend to use my sisters bike to go places rather than taking our car. I have now voted for the first time in my life and will continue to do so to better our country, and I plan on being able to participate in activists related things. There is defiantly more room for improvement, but for a nineteen-year-old woman in today’s society, I’d say I’m doing pretty darn good and dare I say doing more than most adults today. So, thank you Ken, thank you for giving me this opportunity to help inform others about the petrifying future ahead of us and for the tools to help save it.

This is the longest lecture and most informative lecture video so far. It is amazing that  Ken refines all materials in ENGL23 into a 24 minutes video. I have been exposed to a lot of convincing facts and inspiring personal actions about climate crisis. This video is like a recap to the whole course. It takes me to the first day of this course when I was not aware of the climate crisis, and right now I am motivated.
 <br><br>

This video is a good resource for people who are not taking this course. Ken concisely summaries what is happening on the earth and gives people effective solutions. Transportation takes a large part in this video, and it makes up a large portion of carbon emission. I am particularly interested in this subject because a recent statistics has shown that over 70% of citizens in the US own at least a car. I doubt replacing cars with bikes or other transportation tool can be the biggest obstacle in front of changing people’s lifestyle, and I wish these videos can help people change their minds of owning a car.

I really loved the way that Ken had wrapped up this course. It really felt motivating and emotional, as the world is in our hands. These changes that we make now will have a great impact on not only us in the future but possibly our kids and grandchildren. I feel that Ken’s list provided a clear layout that many can follow. This course has been eye-opening, as I have also spread the knowledge from this course to others, especially those completely oblivious to the cause. I follow 18/20 of these solutions, and, honestly, it makes me feel proud. I’m very glad that I stumbled upon this course and have learned so much and so many facts that I can use to convince others to take action with me. This course has been a roller coaster, as there were many times when I have felt anger and frustration at the world, or even sad knowing that my friends and family members don’t do enough for the cause. But, in the end, I am now feeling more motivated than ever, as this education will help me and the environment in the long run. I would also like to shout out Ken in teaching this course and not being a hypocrite. I feel as if any other person would have taught this course it would not be as successful. I also think it’s important to look back and watch the YouTube videos if I ever wanted to refresh my knowledge. This course has really made me self-aware in what I am doing for the climate, and what I can do to convince other people to do the same. Thank you Ken for widening my eyes on what I now see as one of the biggest issues the world is facing.

I like this video. Though many of the suggestions for the second list of 10 things you can do got a bit repetitive, I think that many solid approaches were put forth in order to reduce one’s carbon footprint.
 <br><br>


When discussing more institutional change that’s needed, I found that many of the solutions listed were subcategories of each other. For example, talking to 5+ people and sharing the knowledge that you acquire about the climate crisis are essentially the same idea. 

 <br><br>

I’m not trying to put down sharing knowledge, as that’s absolutely essential when it comes to this issue, however I don’t think it’s fair to pose that there are an equal number of ways to cause institutional change as change on a personal level. The fact remains that we, those who aren’t involved in this things on a high political or corporate level, simply don’t have the power to instill that change. Again, this isn’t to discourage voting or attempting to implement change, but there are certain folks we simply need to convince to dismantle the structures that support our damage to the environment. 

 <br><br>

The second half of the video seems to boil down to this: educate yourself and others on the climate crisis and do what you can (politically, socially, corporately, or otherwise) to practice what you preach - an excellent message to be communicated.

<p>

This video was once again one that left me feeling inspired. Often times reviewing the climate crisis leaves you hopeless and overwhelmed, as it is impossible for an individual to make the huge global changes necessary to combat the crisis. However, Ken reminds us with these 20 simple ways that we truly can make a difference, one bit at a time. Although each of these seems easy enough in their own ways, I think it is crucial when spreading awareness of these ideas to also remind the public that these suggestions aren’t meant to limit the freedoms and control the lives of those who follow them, but that they have benefits in their own rights. For example, not only does being conscious of one’s food choices (suggestion #2) benefit the planet by reducing excessive emissions from its production / importation, but it also saves one money, as these choices usually cost a bit to a significant amount more than choices that are in-season. Further, by choosing to take slower travel like trains and buses instead of air travel (suggestion 7), it doesn’t only reduce unnecessary greenhouse emissions, but also allows one to take in the journey to their destination and adds to the quality and uniqueness of the trip. 
 <br><br>

The ideas that relate to striving to become and remain educated about such environmental issues (suggestions 16 and 17), and those that include voting as a main way to create such changes (suggestions 11 and 12) are all notions that should be done anyway in our democratic society, making the climate benefits a positive side effect. Ken’s lecture proves that most, if not all, of these simple life changes are not impositions, but ways in which to stay most connected, present, and appreciative in our lives.

I really enjoyed your comment as you zoned in on how well Ken is able to take such an intimidating and often discouraging topic and transform it into something more approachable and optimistic. Much of the literature on the climate crisis tends to be focused on scaring us into action, which is not always effective as it can increase climate anxiety and hinder action. It can be difficult to find action plans rather than scare tactics when it comes to the climate crisis so I am glad that Ken has provided us with a comprehensive and reliable video that we can share with others, which conveniently goes hand in hand with suggestion 16. As you mentioned, Ken does an excellent job of showing us how we can actively participate in change through our personal actions as well as through sharing these actions with those around us. 

 <br><br>

Another point that you made that I found particularly intriguing was the idea that we can encourage more people by showing them how these changes will benefit not only the planet, but will benefit them personally. As much as we might hate to admit it and own up to it, Americans tend to be incredibly self centered people at least every once in a while. While our society’s structure is partially to blame for our selfish mindsets, this is a problem that we need to keep in mind when rewriting and rethinking the structure of the outdated “American dream,” as referenced in suggestion 17. It is an incredible idea to target this mindset when suggesting solutions because it could lead to even the “Uncle Pete’s” in our lives deciding to make changes because they focus more on the personal benefits than the environmental benefits. No matter the reason for change, the change itself is what really matters. 

 <br><br>

With twenty actions it is more than possible to find at least a few that we can each adopt to fit with our own unique lifestyles. One quite simple action that can be taken by most people is to vote, as mentioned in suggestions 11 and 12. While voting does require prior research and should be taken seriously, it is something that can be physically done relatively quickly, with the longest part typically being the wait in line. Voting is an incredibly impactful action when done with careful consideration because green policy needs to be put in place that will make limiting emissions a strict requirement rather than a loosely regulated suggestion. As you mentioned, we are a democratic society, and we need to acknowledge this by exercising the right to vote. A lot of people are not lucky enough to be granted the opportunity to have their voice heard and it is important that we do our best to use our vote to make change that will benefit our planet as well as everyone and everything that lives on it.


<br><hr>
I agree that many of the solutions that Ken summarizes in this video can have multiple positive effects. They can benefit not only our climate but also the world around us. While many of these actions may also help the environment, they also can help our own ways of living as well. For example, by implementing solution #2 and eating as a Climatarian, the individual can also benefit from the situation. By choosing a turkey burger over a traditional beef burger, the individual not only contributes fewer carbon emissions from the production of their meal, but they also made a healthier lifestyle choice. This may be a simplified example but it makes the same argument as your comment, that these solutions are not supposed to rule over peoples’ lives and take away their fundamental rights. Instead, they are meant to benefit our planet and in the long term also benefit us as individuals. 
 <br><br>
I also agree with the notion of the idea that many of these solutions can be implemented together. As Ken notes in his lecture, solutions 5 and 6 can both be implemented by moving into a city. An individual could live in a smaller micro-apartment while also commuting by walking. This is just another example to demonstrate that these lifestyle changes are easy to implement without fundamentally changing our ways of life.
 <br><br>
Lastly, I chose to respond to your comment because of your argument that these lifestyle changes are an opportunity to remain optimistic and hopeful in our own lives. Many view these eco-friendly solutions as a violation of their rights and as we have discussed in this course, feel guilty about their actions in response to being faced with these consequences. However, I agree with your idea that these changes are a way for us to appreciate our own lives. By implementing some of the changes that Ken notes in this video, an individual could change their life for the better while also helping the environment in the process.

<br><hr>
I also thought this is a great recap video as we are slowly approaching the end of this quarter. This video reminds me of the things I could do on a personal level and how I should influence those around me to make larger, collective impacts. Similar to you, I found the notion of slow travel to be particularly intriguing, but I think I need to work on #8 (voluntary minimalism and reduce the unnecessary stuff we purchase) and #10 (purchasing items from companies with environmentally just and socially just practices). This video definitely serves as a guideline as to how we could eliminate carbon footprint efficiently through changing some of our everyday behaviors and decisions without having cognitive dissonance. Collectively, I think it is important to share what we think and what we do to help the environment with others to encourage a shift in culture, and #18 speaks a lot of volumes about how we live in the society.
<br><hr>
I completely agree with your feedback on the video. This was a great wrap up of the course, condensing all the overwhelming information we’ve learned into a clear, condensed list. Overall, the key to saving our planet is more education and more action. When I first started this class, I never would’ve imagined that there were 20 simple steps I could take to make a difference. Now that we know better, it is up to us to spread this information and better the world one step at a time. Our current relationship with the earth is toxic; something’s gotta give. And without more action and more education, it’ll be the human race who pays the price. To stop climate change, our societies need to change. Reviewing the various statistics and research articles, it’s clear that the little changes we made have huge impacts, and not just on our climate. The climate crisis is intertwined with so many parts of our society; doing something such as choosing to eat less meat only benefits the climate, but also improves one's health and could even save money. In general, I believe that if society moves to use its resources more efficiently, it will help our climate and economy. We need to stop normalizing perfection. The amount of deformed fruits and veggies that are thrown out on a weekly basis not only hurts our atmosphere, but the producers who lose money solely on the basis of “ugly.” We as individuals have the freedom to choose better. And by doing so, the quality of our lives is notably proven to increase.  When looking at the big picture, going against the status quo and living greener has innumerable advantages.

It feels pretty awesome to watch this lecture; it's kind of like a grand summation of what the course has been leading up to. It felt so satisfying to watch Ken list through the solutions that we've learned, and it was fun reminiscing of all the fun times I had in this class learning about them. I learned a lot this quarter about the sustainability of my actions--what I could do better, what I'm doing right, and what I see in others. I think the most valuable ways that Ken listed in the video are the ones that call for cultural change, such as educating boys and girls fairly to reduce the rate of pregnancy, and to use contraception too. I like these solutions because they paint the image of the slightly misogynistic things that are naturally ingrained in American mindsets, such as normalizing unprotected sex because it promotes the American ideology of raising a beautiful family. Though these are the most interesting solutions to me, they are definitely the least instantaneous of all of the other solutions, because rewiring an entire culture will take too long, and we do not have enough time to wait for a cultural shift. I think the quickest solution we could have is to pressure politicians to take on environmental-friendly policies, because they have the power to influence a change in millions of Americans lives.

I absolutely loved this lecture because it brought all of the methods of lowering emissions to fruition in one condensed video. I think that simplified, yet very informative videos like this one will prove to be strong tools to utilize for my skeptical family members. Although I preserve numerous pieces of information regarding the climate crisis in my head, I find it difficult to voice my knowledge to others. Thank you, Ken, for releasing a video that lays out everything I want to tell my family but find trouble with.
 <br><br>


A couple items off the list that stood out to me were #4: educating boys and girls fairly ,and #12: voting for environmental initiatives. I think a compelling aspect of this crisis is that a lot of our problem’s roots lie in social foundations. For example, denying women the just access to contraception and education is stealing her right to population control and environmental awareness. How will we make meaningful progress if the other half of our gender makeup isn’t provided with the same opportunity to change? In a lot of developing countries, women must give birth and release more emissions to care for their many children. This is not their fault, but rather for survival in a region that still relies on materials like coal. Furthermore, voting for environmental initiates ensures that our legislation will align with environmental interests.

After watching this lecture video, I feel really guilty for what I have done in the past; I can relate to a lot of things like constantly browsing and then buying something that I probably do not need or something I have enough of. And for keeping what we have longer and repairing it when it is broken are also really good ways to prevent from buying more unnecessary things. People are throwing things away when there is only some minor damage and buying a new one with the same quality which would lead to the bad cycle of throwing and buying. However, for one of the ways that we can save the planet which is to have fewer babies, I am a little confused by that. It may bring us another global problem other than the environmental crisis, which is the aging population. Having fewer babies does help with the environment, but I do not think that we should solve this by bringing up another problem. In Japan and South Korea, the birth rate they have a re so low that people are going to work even when they are really old. People are choosing to not have babies for so many reasons,  and if the climate crisis becomes another reason for people to have fewer babies or even not have any, I don’t know what to expect for the future.

What a great video. I wish I had more to say about this, but I feel like so much has already been covered, or will be covered in the letter to the future. I guess-- if nothing else-- I'll muse to myself about how I shape up on this list.  

 <br><br>

I've been trying to do most of the things here. I limit my meat heavily, was a vegetarian for two years, and am trying to get back into it... I can't say I'm very conscious of food choice outside of meat vs no meat, though I guess I don't eat much asparagus, ha... I'm fiercely against bringing children into this world until we solve climate change and the many crises facing our time, that's just cruel... I'm certainly pro-all-education... I walk or use the bus everywhere on campus, only using my car for long-distance travel where mass transit doesn't reach efficiently or well... I live in a small house and plan to pretty much forever... I do fly far more than I should for long distances, but our trains just aren't good; the only solution there is just not going cross-coast, which honestly seems to be the right solution right now... I buy outrageously little, and what I do buy is almost all virtual (aka video games)... I don't really every repair or trade, but that's because I similarly don't really get physical items often... I don't pay attention to which companies are environmental... I've been very politically active pro-environmentally... same for initiatives... same for telling people... as a founder of UCSB for Bernie, I definitely have gathered activists and people together to help fight climate change... protested... read and educated... have thought about why it's so important... have shared knowledge to help build solutions and have helped built pro-climate policies... have joined initiatives... mmm. So let's just go with the first 19. I have... 

 <br><br>

15.5/19. A solid B-. Honestly, that's... less than I thought. I don't think I can really give myself #20 here; I'd have to be doing better for that! I'd really need to focus more on, especially, using less air travel when going long distances, doing even more to reel in my diet, and repairing more. Oh no-- I'll have to get actual real-world skills, ha! 

 <br><br>

Well, there's certainly room to improve... and I'm going to keep working on it. Let's see how this goes.





</p><hr>


<p>

I appreciate Ken’s clear breakdown of each solution and why it’s so important. All of these solutions should be implemented into our daily lives. For example, I’ve decided to stop eating meat for 5 out of the 7 days of the week. The goal is to transition to a completely vegetarian and eventually vegan lifestyle. It’s key to start somewhere and move forward. Ken is a proud vegan, and I can’t wait for that to be me! Also, I believe in buying only what I need. As a whole, we need to all purchase fewer things. I feel as though it’s easier for me because I live in an apartment with six other people and don’t need a lot of things. I plan to continue with this mindset as I grow older and I hope I inspire others to do the same.

I think it is amazing that you are making goals after being inspired after this class! This course inspired me as well. I want to do better in reducing my carbon footprint, but it is not an overnight thing, it is a journey. I applaud you for setting goals and following them so diligently. I agree with you that we all need to take individual action, like buying less and eating mostly plant-based. The most important thing for us to do is VOTE. By voting, we can elect officials that care about and want to make a difference regarding climate change. I am so thankful for this list that he has summarized for us.

This particular lecture video wrapped up this entire class into one video, much like a synopsis for a movie. It gave great insight/summary into what the climate crisis actually is about in a really concise way. Ken split up his 20 solutions into personal action/solutions and collective/political actions. I think they’re all valuable, but a few did stand out to me. Overpopulation and overcrowding is definitely prominent in today’s society, so educating the youth is of utmost importance. If we continue to overpopulate our Earth as well as pollute it with carbon emissions, we may not have a habitable Earth for much longer. Voting and educating others about the climate crisis is also important in making larger changes. There are so many misconceptions about the climate crisis, and clarifying those for someone could make a difference. Additionally, younger generations must vote because people in office for the U.S. government are much older, and do not necessarily care for topics like climate change. Therefore, we need to vote for individuals who plan on taking action against climate change.  Ultimately, personal action, activism, and collective/political action all work as a unit to achieve a great effect. It’s just a matter of standing up and putting our thoughts/words into action. Personally, I’ve already started doing so starting with looking more into political elections and voting. Additionally, reducing food waste and taking on a more minimalist approach to a daily lifestyle has become more apparent in my own life.

I found this video pretty informative. Ken did a good job wrapping up the key solutions talked about during the quarter. I feel I am now better equipped to not only inform people of climate change but I can now take action and do my part to decrease my carbon footprint. Whenever I try to go eat food I try to carpool with as many people as possible so that less cars will be on the road. I also make sure to do simple things like turning off the lights, tv etc when I leave the room. I am also trying to get my friends active when it comes to voting. It is important we try and not only improve on an individual scale but a collective one as well.

This is one of my favorite lecture videos thus far in this course. To begin my comment, I'd thank to thank Ken for taking the time to make this video as it serves as a great review, as mentioned, and this video is something I can recommend to my friends who want to become more educated on the climate crisis. I believe that personal action, in terms of the actions presented on this list, is something that everyone can become involved in which is why I found this video to be so important. It doesn't take much effort to become aware, it simply requires learning about your surroundings and the events going on around you. From this you will become an educated member of society able to properly articulate your opinions, and express them in your daily life (and most importantly express them while voting). Once you have gained awareness, it is the second step, into becoming an active practitioner in a greener lifestyle that may take more effort than most people are willing to give. However, as Ken discussed, it doesn't take much to limit your carbon emissions. While going vegan may be a daunting task for those meat lovers of America, why not just do a vegan meal once a week, or take it further and dedicate a day of your week to plant based dietary restrictions. This type of change can be applied to every point mentioned in the lecture, if you take a small step towards each of these goals then your carbon emissions will decrease substantially. Furthermore, this ability all comes from the process of becoming aware and acting in accordance with the knowledge you have gained. As I read in a previous comment, "passion and motivation is necessary to enact change". Find one or two things on this list that you are passionate about, whether its: political action, being vegan, biking, thrifting, practicing minimalism, encouraging education rights, fighting for safe and available contraceptives or even just reading, take this passion and use it to help the environment. I believe that if everyone could see how easy it is to enact a lifestyle change then society would notice a great interest in fighting the climate crisis, but it is the lack of knowledge and the belief that climate activists are too radical and unrealistic that is proving to be a detriment for the future of the planet.

The points you made from this lecture are all important and accurate. I too believe that all people well-off enough to make decisions as a consumer can adjust them to be more in line with protecting our environment and planet. Some of the things Ken mentioned that stuck with me are that cutting out food waste will have a bigger impact than everyone eating a plant-based diet. True though that a combination of buying enough to eat and nothing more, along with being a climatarian or freegan can have an enormous positive impact on the amount of carbon emissions each person contributes. This video shows us that there are so many choices we can make to minimize our effect on the environment, such as being educated about how many kids we should have or living smaller and more minimally. I do agree with Ken that the biggest thing we can do to ensure we are headed in the right direction is to vote. The policies and institutions in place have a huge impact on how consumers act. If plastic bags are banned or cost consumers, you will see a decrease in their use. Otherwise, there would be people reusing bags on their own, but many others would continue to use plastic bags. Now, there is a monetary incentive to bring your own to the store. This is a good example of the direct relationship between voting/policies and consumer choice. On the way to better laws, we can all educate others around us about actions they can take in their homes and in the streets as well.

<p>

I find it interesting how Ken categorizes different solutions for individual and collective action. I believe that he did so mainly because these two actions have different practical solutions. The use of contraception may be a little trick to "less children" or even "adoption." If you adopt a child and give him / her / them a happy, simple life, full of joy, and not driven by material wealth, then you give them the greatest gift of their life.
 <br><br>
As far as individualistic solutions are concerned, I think many of them are very feasible and should be implemented by everyone. Although it may not have such a large impact on the environment in the short term, the long-term results are comparable. As I wrote in many previous reviews, few things pile up into something bigger. Therefore, if these few individual solutions are met, they can have a very positive impact on the environment.

I think this video is the perfect accumulation of everything we have learned in the class this year. For anyone that isn't actually taking this course, or is planning to in the future, this is a very informative video to give you an idea of everything we have learned over the course of this class. It's almost a bitter-sweet feeling knowing how far we have progressed. When we started this class I felt everything was so pessimistic and dark. I was genuinely scared for the safety of our future. However, as this class has progressed, as I have learned more and more about all the things I can do, I have a much more optimistic view on what I am able to do to preserve our planet. I genuinely think that my generation can accomplish far more than any of us could even imagine. The one positive side of having so many people on this planet is that we have so many great minds that can work towards the best possible future for all of us.

I appreciate ken’s work on his speech in his video. I found many of his suggestions effective and are easy to do. His opinion of having less children is very interesting. To me, I believe that the most basic thing we can do is to waste less food. Everyday when I return my plates, I often see lots of people there with their plates filled with food, left them there and leave. Whenever this moment, I will think of ken’s work and videos. I mean, we should not waste food because we are permitted to do it, we need to care more about the planet. Another suggestion I. Found that is very good is to work together with people who shared the same opinions with you. Go to school with them, learn more new methods from them and achieve them in your life, it can be really great.



</p><hr>


<p>
I really like this video and appreciate that the professor gives us the list that 20 things that we can do to save our earth. 
 <br><br>

To begin with, we should waste less. We buy enough food to eat every time we go to the supermarket and restaurants. In this case, we can waste less food since about 1/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions are due to food production, and about 1/2 of this is due to livestock, according to Peter Kalmus. Second, we can eat more vegetables and less meat. Become a vegan can save our planet to some degree. Although most people have not wanted to sacrifice their chance to eat meat. No doubt being a vegan needs a huge determination because it needs to sacrifice a lot even society made a lot of vegan food now. Thirdly, we also can limit family size since huge population will cause more CO2 emits. Fourth, for students who have taken the course about climate change, they can educate their family members and friends of the things that we can do to save our earth. 
 <br><br>

The other type of things that we can do is about transportation. First, we should take fewer flights because it causes a huge CO2 emission. If we have to take flights, for example, the international students or students who lived in other states. Those people can choose the flight directly to the destination. These can reduce less CO2 emission than the flights which stop once or twice. When we on vacation and traveling, we can choose slow travel over air travel. We can take the train, although it’s slow, we can see more views on the way to the destination. 
 <br><br>

Last but not least, I think we should consume less, especially not to buy unnecessary stuff. Becoming minimalism is hard, but we can try to buy less. When we are shopping, think about whether this stuff is necessary or not. Don’t be impulsive, especially shopping online. The discount may be attractive, but remember, each dollar spent on new stuff represents roughly 0.5 kg embodies CO2e emissions. Think about our future and our descendants’ futures. 
 <br><br>

I believe we can save our planet if we all take action.

In this week's lecture video, Ken did an amazing job summarizing what we learned in the last quarter. The structure of this video makes it easy to understand and track. Before I started this class, I thought vegetarianism was a good way to alleviate the climate crisis, because I saw cowpiracy last class. This is obviously not enough. Even if everyone is a vegetarian, we need to reduce our food waste and see what we eat and when. I love that this video is divided into two parts: personal change and collective political change. I don't think we need to say more about personal changes. We all know that we should pay attention to the details of life and try our best to reduce our carbon footprint so as to make our environment better. Politically, I think we can do very little. It turns out that the activities launched by college students, such as some demonstrations, petitions and signing activities, will not have a great impact, and most of them will not be finished. I don't know if what I'm going to say is appropriate, but I think I have to say it. I think both the cowpiracy and the car are small problems. Food waste is terrible, especially in the United States. I work in Carrillo canteen. I am responsible for washing dishes. The main job is to dump the leftover food into the garbage can. I think it's the leftover soup and the leftover crust. But the reality gave me a big blow, many people take a lot of food very little, so I often see a whole cake or a whole pizza thrown away in white, which is a great impact on me. As a Chinese, I was very frugal from childhood. We are not allowed to leave a grain of rice in the bowl when we eat. It's amazing to see these foods thrown away, so I think Americans should learn from the Chinese spirit of thrift.

Props to Ken for putting up a video that sums up everything, it was really helpful and encouraging to listen to. The fact that Ken posts these videos online and his syllabus on the internet makes it pretty accessible to many.  I think that ever since taking English 22 these classes have really impacted my choices. I hardly ever go shopping for brand new clothes, barely order stuff from online, my diet has changed from meat to mostly plant based. For me, the term climatarian was one of the things that pushed me to do so. I think that being able to do anything that counts like being a climatarian is very important and especially convincing others by just talking about your experience and not pushing it onto them. Seeing the list of the 20 things we can do is so powerful now that I know so much more and after taking English 22. I like how some like 17 really focus on bettering yourself to better your surroundings because taking care of ourselves is very important and the foundation.

I enjoyed this video a lot.  I loved the fact that Ken gave a lot of things we can do for the climate crisis.  He did mention that it might sound repetitive, and he does have a point.  It seems like week after week it is the same solutions mentioned.  However, this is an important fact simply because these are the vitals in order to actually succeed.  Many people only focus on what is wrong and what the problems are.  Instead of focusing on what we need to fix it.  While addressing the problem can have some type of good in it,  actually focusing on what we can do to succeed is far better.  This is because we actually are taking action, rather than just looking at what is wrong and not doing anything to fix the issue.  Taking action is always the best way to fix something because you are actually doing something about it.  Overall, this video had great content, every thing that was stated by Ken was great.   This video sums up the whole class in one.  I agree with Ken that one of the most important things you could do it vote.  All in all, this was a very good lecture video simply for the fact that Ken gave 20 things that each of us could do to save the planet.  Great content.

I think this lecture video is the most useful and my favorite. This lecture video concludes the whole theme and content of this course. And this video summarizes our daily footprint and its harm to the environment, then provides some available and collective actions to guide us to become eco-friendly. I feel very thankful to choose this course. Ken make me to pay attention to some small things that before I thought it is not important. But all of these small things accumulate together will cause big hurt to our environment. In the first part, the video mentions the problem of food consumption. In China, the college dining halls always have some slogans that suggests students not to consume the food. Every rice is very cherished. So, I always eat clearly in China. But in the U.S., sometimes I consumed some meals. I feel regret now and I will not to consume food.

This is one of my favorite lectures since it clearly outlined what we should do to protect the environment individually. I enjoy how he lay out all 20 actions to reduce our CO2 emissions. There are definitely multiple personal changes I want to start doing that Ken mentioned. Firstly, I would like to begin purchasing less stuff, such as clothes, shoes, bags, etc. After entering the college, huge amount of my money went to purchasing things I do not really need. By reducing the purchasing, I can reduce my CO2 emissions and also save money. Secondly, I will take care of my waste of food more. In Chinese tradition, it’s always not good to waste food. I was even asked to finish every single rice in my bowl when I was a child. So I personally do not waste a lot of food. However, after I came to the U.S., the environment seems not that strict about the food waste. In other words, I waste more than I did before. After taking this class, I understand more about the importance of not wasting food and decide to control my food waste strictly. Third is using knowledge to share and implement solutions. In my opinion, sharing is the most significant part in this list. We surely need to share our ideas of protecting the environment to people around us because if we do not, then we are going to be the only ones who do changes, and that’s not enough at all. What we should do is spread the changes to more and more people as we can so that one day, the changes could not be changes anymore but one segment in our culture.

I definitely agreed that this has been one of my favorite lecture videos for the whole quarter. I believe that Ken has done such an amazing job at not only explaining how critical the climate crisis is, but doing a fantastic job at outlining how beneficial these changes can be to our LIVES. This weeks readings were so inspiring, and I feel like this is the best way to end it. 
 <br><br>
In the video, Ken explains all the different ways that we can lessen our carbon footprint. When I was watching, and like you observed, I found that so many options in the list were not only lessening my carbon footprint, but actually are helping me in the long run. Like you said, less shopping and aspiring to get the new latest and greatest material things will result in much more money in the future. That specific example and this video actually reminded me of Kens lecture video about transportation a few weeks ago. I remember him saying that if you do not use a car for most of your life, you will actually be able to retire by the age of 52-55. I honestly think that these options are not only CO2 efficient, but actually create a large amount of value for the person making these changes.

I love this video so much. "Pulling it all together" completely binds what we have been learning all quarter all into one video as the name suggests. But, no matter how much you give us the solutions it has truly be in us to follow through which I doubt most of the American population will have. An that is truly devastating. But so what, fuck it, this movement will catch momentum and will soon dominate American Society at some point, because our children and grandchildren's future depends on it. Lets make it the new norm. Let's make this "Cool" so hopefully all these trend-following idiots can get behind it and grow the momentum. We need every celebrity to exemplify these sort actions and change, not only will they be influencing millions everyday and gain more attention (we know they love it), but they will be be creating a newer and better future and making a difference. We need to stop blaming and pointing fingers at other countries (yes US you fucked up, own up to it), and start coming together to find a solution, something we can all get behind. This isn't a national issue, this is a global epidemic that we must get behind now. I have personally done a lot to change and have educated my parents and my family to the best of my ability so that they can change their actions for the better of this world. We cut down eating meat and utilizing animal products by almost 65-75%. We would eat meat and animal products almost everyday of the week if not every, but now we only consume 2 out of the 7 days. Our business is based of a the ideology of being "Mobile" so our descending levels of car and petrol usage comes in our personal needs unrelated to business and driving the least we possibly can. Even in our home we have based many changes in order to better accommodate the environment, although it can get expensive, you cannot put a price on saving our planet, our real home and future. We can all act upon all these decisions, in which we should, but except one that isn't really available to many of us, which is Voting. Coming from a family of immigrants, voting is something that has just completely been off the table for my family, but they vote through me. For this reason, I believe it is very important for everyone to vote especially all the latinos out there who face the same issue as I do. This video is definitely a video I will recommend to many of my friends and family around me. "Putting it All Together" really efficiently and clearly explains all the possible ways we can make a change, which will help all those around us who don't know what they could do to really understand that making the change isn't difficult. Let's make a change.

I really enjoy this week’s video since it is the summary of the entire course and Ken outlines 20 actions that could be done to save the planet, including 10 personal actions and 10 collective actions. I totally agree with what he says, and this video will definitely be a good recommendation to people around us, encouraging them to take small actions, which may cause a huge effect on the planet as more people join. This is informative and clear as people may be unwilling to hear or read a long-page article about the climate crisis. But Ken also provides evidence and data that support his argument. Some actions provided are just simple to achieve like wasting less food and using contraceptives to limit family size. Moreover, these actions are interrelated. Through the whole course, it is important to remember the severity and urgency of the climate crisis and it is important to keep in mind that we should take action NOW. We cannot waste any time and wait for the next disaster.

I agree with you. This week's video is very inspiring to me. Most times, I felt overwhelmed by the serious situation of the climate crisis and think I can't do anything to reverse the situation. And it is hard to believe that an individual's effort can solve the problem. However, in this video, we can learn 20 actions that could solve the climate crisis. And there are 10 personal actions that are practical for individuals, which provides an outlet for individuals who want to contribute their efforts. But, there is one point I don't agree with you. You said that "Ken outlines 20 actions that could be done to save the planet." I think what we did is not to save the planet but ourselves. We are not that powerful to destroy the planet. The purpose of solving the climate crisis is to make the Earth still habitable for human species in the future.

Thank you for this video and thank you for this class. This class really pulls it all together. I find this video to be the most important that has been put out by you and I’ll be sharing it with some friends and family. One of the things that I’ve really appreciated when watching this video was how I could recall learning all of this. It just shows how much of the things I’ve learned and how much of it stuck with me. In my opinion the biggest thing someone could do to become a climate activist is to question what their definition of happiness is. You know since I was little I thought happiness was materialist. I grew up with very little and I wanted to have what my parents didn’t. My parents came to this country for opportunity and because they envisioned something different for their kids. And while what they envisioned might not have been what they were thinking the general concept was the same. For their kids to live a happy life. But not through materialistic wealth but for having the opportunity to find what makes them happy. I think the all consuming culture that we have in the United States is the most detrimental thing for the planet. The sooner we ditch this way of thinking the faster we here in the states can be the example for change.

After reviewing the twenty things that we can do to protect our planet, I reconsidered my actions and I feel like I need do some changes in my life. First of all, I will not waste food, especially meat. I should buy suitable amount of food. Also, I should eat less meat. I am supposed to change my eating habit to plant based diet gradually. Because raising cows really pollutes our environment. In the future, if I have a happy family, I will persuade my family members to have only one child. Besides, the house we live will not be too large. It can be as small as possible as long as all of my family members can live together with happiness. On the way to work, I will try my best to take public transportation, like subways, buses, and trains. I will travel less. If I have to take an air, I will take non stop flights. What’s more, it is important to buy less clothes, shoes, or other unnecessary stuff. With buying, not only by buying less, sharing, and keeping things longer, but also by only buying from companies with environmentally sound and socially just practices. Another thing we can do to change the situation is to vote for a candidate who are exactly care about the issue of climate crisis. Also, I can advertise to my friends and family members to vote that candidate together. Joining in collectively demand climate action, such as the Sunrise Movement, will also be helpful. When it comes to education, both boys and girls should be educated equally about the issue of climate change. These are some basic things that every citizen can do to stop the climate change. Even though it is not enough if only a few people take an action, I believe with more awareness, the situation will getting better.

Although I have enjoyed quite a few of Ken's lectures, this is one of my favorite ones and definitely the one that I will be directing people to for a class overview and the main points for combatting the climate crisis. I am particularly interested in the first ten things, personal activism. It's easier for me to think of things on a much smaller scale and while voting is very essential to the climate crisis and political activism is very important, I feel like the last ten things are all intertwined and all take some very outspoken, passionate people to lead this movement. I'm all about doing my part and voting, but this class captured my attention more when we focused on what we could do personally to combat climate change. The first ten things I am completely control of and I feel like I can make a difference that way. Just as a personal reflection from this class, I had no idea 99% of the stuff that we learned about. I grew up in a small, conservative farm town; there's absolutely no way anyone would discuss red meat being bad and agriculture causing problems for the planet. I was taught to shop smart, who cares about name brand things, we were more interested in cheap. I was never taught anything about working conditions and how people were being treated and paid close to nothing so that I could buy a cheaper outfit. I have never had a sex-ed class in my life. If we want to educate women about contraceptives and educate them and allow them to take control of their bodies, why doesn't every high school have a mandatory sex-ed class? In my four years of high school, we had 10 girls in our class of 179 kids drop out of school due to teen pregnancy. We need to start in our own country. A high school teacher I had gave my entire class wrong information about pregnancy and contraceptives. We are not nearly as developed as we think we are. And while we need to take a look at the whole world, the developing countries and all, we also need to look at ourselves. Why do we have people starving? Why do we have uneducated women? Why do we not have access to contraceptives and abortion everywhere? We need to start taking action on our side. We can't force people to stop eating red meat or to stop driving cars and there would be way too much backlash if we made a law, but if we could educate people as Ken has done to the hundreds of students in this class and the public who is exploring the class with us, then we could have a lot more support in this issue.

I too enjoy how Ken split these into individual solutions and political solutions. I feel as though these almost entirely encompass the possible solutions to counteracting climate change effectively. I like you, do feel as though personal activism is the easiest course of action because It's much easier to control what you personally do rather than try and influence the actions of others. What I will say is I do understand the value of climate activism and using our voices to make a change. We have been extremely fortunate to be put in a position like this, in which we are being educated on a topic very few have access to. I believe it is our duty and privilege to be able to speak out on behalf of our planet and spread awareness to this extremely pressing issue because, at this point in time, we need all hands on deck. Bernie himself has been campaigning on behalf of this issue for years and you can see how many Americans STILL don't recognize the extent of this problem. If we were able to educate the general masses with even a fraction of the information we've learned in this class, we could change the course of mankind, no exaggeration. Just like the other points, you made about sex ed, the spread of information is key to countering the spread of ignorance which inevitably runs rampant through the general population as a result of lack of proper teaching or access to resources.

I agree with you. This is also my favorite lecture snippet so far, and it is definitely the one that should be promoted and learn from. Ken summarized and concluded all the main topics of the course into this video and clearly listed ten individual actions as well as ten political and collective actions that could help mitigating the climate crisis. The individual actions addressed many topics such as having a plant based diet, reducing food waste, taking public and slow transportation, and buying less and so on. The collective actions include voting, collaboration, education, activism, and making changes through the government. I cannot emphasize the importance of encouraging younger generations to vote for those who are going to take charge in the fight against climate crisis too much. After this class, I would continue using the learned ways and trying my best to greatly reduce my CO2 emission. I would also like to share this amazing video with others so they can acquire more knowledge about the climate change and learn more effective ways to make lifestyle changes.
<br><hr>
I also appreciate how Ken emphasized how important it is for women to have the right to their bodies. Using contraception and educating women will limit family sizes. I found it insane that we have 85 million unplanned pregnancies every year. Learning about contraception in sex-ed is so important while young and it makes me so mad at the parents who argue with the schools to get rid of it because its ‘not appropriate’ while they have a pregnant 15-year-old. I also knew several girls in high school who dropped out after getting pregnant. I was shocked as the years went by and the girls who were pregnant were younger and younger. A 14/15-year-old getting pregnant is ridiculous and I agree that we really need to do something about that and stop pointing fingers at other developing countries. It was very interesting to look at it from an environmental standpoint instead of just as a social issue. Hopefully, there is more awareness about issues like this and others related to climate change since there are many students like us educating others about what we have learned.

I thought that this was a great way to recap the course. Honestly, before the class even started, I didn't know much about climate change (or even if it was real or not) and I couldn't care less about it. After the whole course, not only did I learn that climate change was 'very' real and a threat to our existence, I was given the knowledge and the tools to combat against it. They are many ways we can do this, either individually, locally, or nationally. Personally, I believe that voting (or a change in government)will be the most effective way to create impactful action, as change on a national scale would be more effective. In all, I'm really glad I took this course, as Ken did well to provide knowledge about identifying and acting to fight the global menace that threatens us all.

<p>
This video was very comprehensive and went through most of the information covered throughout this entire quarter. Though it might sound quite repetitive to most of us who took this call with Ken, I think it would be an educative video for those learning more on what they can do to combat climate change. This list may seem long and quite dense, but if you break down each individual solution most of these changes shouldn’t be too hard to apply. Most of the solutions can be brought to everyone’s attention through educating. We should be able to run ads and youtube videos to inform those on changes that can be made.

It is definitely my favorite one among all the videos in his course! Actually, I decided to recommend this to my family and friends. I sometimes wonder about how to share the information I learned in this course to others. Many times I lose in the first step because there are plenty of things I want to say but I don't know where to start and what sequence to list. This video solves my problem. The 20 things are combined and list out logically so that one with no background in this field can quickly have a basic idea about what personal actions can reduce climate change. For example, buy the right amount of food to avoid food waste, limit family size, and live as a form of minimalism. This video summaries almost every main point in the climate crisis, which made it a good resource for preparing the final exam. Of course, it means more than that. I strongly recommend you to share it with your friends and family. Show them that there are so many things we can do to change our living environment and each piece of advice can lead to huge differences. If they combined, the result will beyond imagination! Actually, share it with others is one of the suggestions in this video--telling people around about climate change and its solutions.

I agree, this too was my favorite video in this course. I think it is a great video to share to friends and family (which I did) because it is easy to understand and does not require lots of previous background knowledge on topics regarding the climate crisis. I still think that educating people on the climate crisis is such a pivotal step in creating a movement for change. Like Ken has stated in previous videos, unless acted upon, knowledge is power squandered. By giving people a list that includes personal actions that can be taken to help mitigate the climate crisis, they can work towards making concrete steps towards positive change. We are in this together no doubt, and every personal change we make towards living a sustainable lifestyle is not only beneficial for future human generations, but all life on earth that is affected by our actions.

I agree that this is a fitting video to share with people in your life that you wish to be aware of the climate crisis and what they can do in their daily decision-making to help combat the crisis. This lecture video’s simplicity and straight-forwardness is the kind of content we need to raise awareness. Awareness is crucial and what I think is the most important step in even beginning to save our planet. We cannot expect everyone to immediately know what they could/should be doing to live sustainably and what impact these practices will have on the planet. Making awareness accessible and comprehensible to everyone is a key part of this step. I find Ken’s video to be an exemplary way of spreading the word on the impacts that the way we live our lives has on the environment. I found this lecture video to be inspiring and I think it really focuses on what we CAN do and gives us a sense of what we have control over in our lives. A sense of hope for the future is instilled in the viewer and I think that hope can go a long way.

This video was very intriguing and informative. I believe that this video can be extremely useful in sparking interest in those who aren’t already informed or motivated about the climate crisis. Saving the planet as Ken said is not just for the sake of humans, but for the other species who have been caught in our crossfire. Personally, I believe the biggest changes that need to happen across the world are politicians who care and will take action to solve the climate crisis, educating boys and girls across the world, and moving to cleaner forms of energy. I personally believe it is now my duty to inform those who have not been educated and to stop the spread of consumerism. Minimalism is where we as a whole species need to go. It is unfair that the wealthy can cause this much suffering to those who cannot do anything about it. I want to thank Ken for inspiring and educating me these last two quarters on an issue I did not know too much about. He’s inspired me to pursue a career where I can work towards protecting the earth and solving climate change. This video gives you numerous ways to make a change in the world and I will be sharing with my friends and family.

This lecture genuinely gave me so much hope, and I feel like was the perfect way to wrap up this class, because it shows every single one of us in a succinct video everything that we have learned in this class and everything that we are able to take forward and use and implement in our daily lives. There is so much that we can do, literally starting tomorrow, actually starting this second, we can make the choice and decide to just change the way we live and start to make a difference. While this may look different for everyone that sits and listens to Ken’s lectures, and in general different for everyone around the world, this class has ensured that every single time I enter a plane or I plan on wasting a piece of bread or use my car for a short distance, I will have to consciously make a choice to betray my planet, betray all the animals that are nearly becoming extinct. This class has forever changed my life, because it was changed my perspective on a lot of things and has genuinely made me want to become  a better, more responsible person. 
<br><br>
Listen to the things that Ken is saying in this lecture, how many of his solutions are that saving the planet begins at markets and restaurants, in the bedroom, at meals, in the classroom, on the way to work, at home, on vacation and when travelling. These are all civilian things that we do in our everyday lives and thus things that we can alter to better ourselves in our everyday lives! It gives me hope that to an extent the fate of the world rests in the hands of the people just as much as it rests in the hands of major corporations and politicians. We can decrease food waste and change the way we eat to become climatarians and we can advocate for safe sex education, we can do all of this without the need for a bigger, more powerful organization helping or sponsoring us. These are all things that we can implement tomorrow, today even if we wish to.
<br><br>

Despite me stating that we can do so much ourselves and we don’t need politicians and corporates support (which is true in certain cases) that is only half the story. WE cannot ignore the grey elephant in the room and that is fossil fuels and the extreme harm they do to the environment. That is why, we have heard it a thousand, million times but it still remains so true and so important! WE NEED TO VOTE! Vote for candidates that put people and the planet before profits, vote for candidates that are advocating for sweeping climate policies like carbon pricing and the Green New Deal! If we can elect the right president and the right governors and congress women/men into office, our fight against climate change will be far less difficult and far less opposed. Also, as Ken has mentioned many times, you also need to convince your parents, friends and family to vote for these candidates, because however strong one voice is, a collective body’s voice is much stronger, louder and more powerful!

I enjoyed the set up Ken took with this video as well, as his breakdown of the list into what we can do both as individuals and as a community makes it approachable to achieve. This course has had me actively judging my own personal actions, most often in regard to food consumption, shopping and housing. Within my own group of friends who are also taking this course, we’ve often joked of whether or not Ken would ‘approve’ or not of our actions, which subconsciously we all evaluated. Talking about this course around others, it became really easy to start conversations about our environmental impact, specifically food consumption, as we’d all gather for meals. This has resulted in many of us encouraging one another to eat better for either our own health, as well as for the environment.
<br><br>
Leaving this class for one of the last times this week, I feel that I walk away with tools to help me both evaluate and recognize the problem areas in my life, in regard to my global emissions. I have actively chosen to eat better, and with less meat/beef within my life, for health and environmental reasons. I also have actively reduced my shopping habits, by thinking more of needs vs wants, and in regard to housing, moving signing onto a lease for a home with many others. 
<br><br>
I also agree that voting is truly the only way forward in regard to proactively seeking and achieving change. Activism within itself isn’t enough, but when everyone involves themselves and shares their own values, advocating becomes much more powerful, as support individuals of various backgrounds reaching office, to address the problems at hand.
<br><hr>
I completely relate and agree with your whole entire comment. This is by far one of my favorite videos in the course because it truly ties together everything that we have learned throughout the whole entire quarter. It acknowledges that climate change is not just a scientific issue but an issue that involves politics, society and our culture. We should all strive to decolonize the norm of the “American Dream” and the motto “The bigger the better.” Simply doing small things such as eating a plant based diet, minimalism, having a garden and repairing/trading goods can easily have a huge impact on the world itself. Taking action is one of the most significant factors when trying to make an impact. Education and acknowledging what is harmful is COMPLETELY useless if individuals do not become problem solvers, start creating solutions and take action on their knowledge. I agree, we are able to take action at any moment in our lives, we have the ability to realize what is happening and make different choices in our lives that will ultimately have a positive impact on the planet.

I can not express enough how much this class has truly changed my perspective on everything and anything I do. I have came to the same exact realization that you have; this class has ensured that every single time I enter a plane, eat meat, buy clothes or using my car even for a short distance, I will be consciously making the choice to betray the planet, all the animals that are nearly becoming extinct and the third world countries suffering from our own first world actions. It is truly heartbreaking that people are using the privilege and luxuries we are so lucky to have in awful and selfish manners. This class has forever changed my perspective on multiple things and has also genuinely made me want to become a more environmentally responsible person by living a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle. It takes little to no effort to do half the things on this list. For example, simply taking 5 minutes out of your day to go and vote. I ABSOLUTELY loved your statement: “Vote for candidates that put people and the planet before profits, vote for candidates that are advocating for sweeping climate policies like carbon pricing and the Green New Deal! If we can elect the right president and the right governors and congress women/men into office, our fight against climate change will be far less difficult and far less opposed.” I cannot reiterate this enough!!! Change starts with taking ACTION and becoming a UNIT in order to become stronger, louder and POWERFUL. We should all live by the motto of becoming the change you want to see in the world. This video is definitely one that I would recommend to all of my family and friends.

Thank you Ken, telling us how we can save the environment. First, plant-based diet is useful, there is a joke during corona virus period that people are stocking a lot of stuffs and most are sold out except plant-based diet, which means people are not really paying attention to being a plant savor. People should eat for the better environment of the plant and the climate. Also solar energy is useful, coal is always created form the plant and cannot get back again. Family planning and education for girls is the most important, since this reduce population from the base and decrease the demanding. It is also about human right education, since girls are not treated equally through the whole wide world, some of them still cannot control their own bodies. I feel like saving the plant also means to save ourselves, helping the plant is helping ourselves.

I found it very interesting how Ken categorizes different solutions for individual and collective action. I believe he did this largely due to the fact there are very different tangible solutions for both actions. For instance, collective action is a lot more bureaucratic and often can be very difficult to impose/initiate. However, once implemented collective action can prove to have enormous positive impacts and can oftentimes lead to very large widespread. For instance, one of the solutions proposed was to limit flights. As mentioned above, there is a mass amount of bureaucracy involved which would make something like limiting flights near impossible. This is due to the fact that flying contributes so much to the global economy. Businessmen, artists, athletes and political figures are all heavily reliant on air travel and thus, flying is imperative for such fellows. Furthermore, the international trade of goods will be highly distorted from the limitation of flying which would then cost businesses and countries a lot of money.  In terms of the individualistic solutions, I think many of them are very feasible and should be implemented by everyone. Although it may not have such a mass effect on the environment in the short run, the long-run outcome is very comparable. As I have written in many of my previous comments, little things will accumulate into something much larger. Thus, if these little individual solutions are met, there could be a very positive impact on the environment.

I like how this video was an overview of everything covered in the class. It explained all the possible solutions we've gone over in class and how we could implement these changes into our personal lives. Throughout this class I started to realize more and more how much of an impact I can make on the climate crisis just on making personal life changes. This could be changing my diet to a more sustainable one or limiting my consumption of stuff in general and living a more minimalist life. This makes me more hopeful for the future as its seems more realistic that we can actually solve the issue of climate change if we act correctly. I also like how Professor Hiltner stressed the importance of voting when trying to make a change because while yes we can take on personal action against climate change, it also doesn’t hurt to vote for possible solutions to the climate crisis in addition.

I completely agree that this video was so great because it explained 20 of the most helpful things we can do individually that will reduce our carbon footprint immensely. And it did it all in about 25 minutes. Sharing this with others will be so much easier especially to those individuals who do not want to be listening to long speeches about why we should care about the environment. Spreading awareness is so important and this video just did that so greatly. In addition to this, I realized that now at the end of the quarter, I have made more changes in my daily lifestyle that have reduced my carbon footprint. I have been more aware about what I decide to eat, I now either bike or walk to campus and take the bus to go grocery shopping, but by far the biggest difference for me is practicing minimalism. I was such a big fan of online shopping and I’m literally known as the friend who needs to stop spending her money so much. I’ve only bought things that I actually need and I’ve made sure they’re things that I know I would actually love to keep in my closet for a long time. I could honestly understand what many had said about minimalism and it has made me so much more happy because it doesn’t feel like owning meaningless invaluable things. I definitely am very hopeful that as more awareness is spread about the impacts our choices in personal lifestyles has on the environment and what we can do to change that, the more people can fastly reduce their carbon footprints.

This may have to be one of my favorite lecture videos of Ken’s! I really enjoyed how he was able to lay out all 20 ways we can take personal and communal action to help fix the climate crisis and reduce our carbon footprints. Ken was able to provide a great summary of what we have learned this year in one video in a simple and easy way to understand. Although some of the facts seemed repetitive, it was refreshing to hear everything we have learned again. This video allowed me to become more excited and intrigued to start with personal changes because some of these actions are extremely easy. Taking personal action is vital and it is not hard to make some of these changes in one's daily life. There are definitely multiple personal changes I want to start making that Ken mentioned. One of these being to shop less. This is something I struggle with a lot because I am always so tempted to buy unnecessary things at the store. However, I want to limit myself from spending money on materialistic items and instead enjoy more time with family and friends. Hanging out with friends and family is a good/healthy distraction from shopping. I also want to start being more conscious about what I eat. I’ve always been aware of the vegetarian and vegan diets, but never the climatarian diet. I want to start eating foods that are environmentally better, not only for myself but the planet too. Overall, I think this lecture video was interesting and did a great job at laying out all the details of what we can do to make a change for the planet.

This was also one of my favorite lectures yet. All 20 ways to take action were realistic and could be easily implemented in anyones life. The solutions to this issue are not difficult and will have such a large impact on our future. I feel like after this course, I actively try every day to engage or not engage in activities or behaviors that will make my carbon footprint larger. The first half of the video discusses the food, transportation, and consumer industries. I love freeganism and the idea of being a climetarian. I have been vegaterian for years and still use almond milk and almond butter. By becoming a climaterian, I would likely start to use oat milk, and peanut butter because of the large amounts of waste in almond production. When it comes to buying items, I have definitely become more frugal and creative. I will no longer spend money at fast fashion stores. In addition, I will rework my old clothing so I can rewear it or just sell to a second hand store.
<br><br>
The second part of the video was also fascinating. I really liked how Ken mentioned voting and protesting. I think that a lot of people use the excuse that they can't control the technicalities of the food industry or issues such as fracking. However, voting gives people ultimate control. By electing individuals who are in support of making a climate difference, laws will be set against carbon emission producing activities. After taking this class, I was more motivated than ever to participate in the past election on March 3rd. Thank you Ken for all of these videos, lectures, and resources!
<br><hr>
 this has to be up there with my favorite videos from this course as well. For a while before I took this class, I had felt like even making personal changes to myself and my life would not be significant enough to help the environment. Ken’s list of personal things that we can do to save the planet have shown me that that thought is not true; if I cut down on at least a bit from each point that he listed, I will probably overall reduce my impact on the environment significantly. Of course, for it to be more effective, I would have to continue to reduce, but knowing that changing my life little by little would still be helpful has made me rethink my previous mentality.

After listening to this lecture, and all of the previous lectures, its amazing how basic some of these changes that we have talked about really are. Educating everyone and voting for things that matter(like the climate) seem almost trivial to have to tell people that we need to do. These things should be basic things that everyone in society goes through, especially in a country such as USA where we are a leader in global affairs. Besides that, this video was a great summary of what a majority of this course covered. Most people are extremely busy in their lives to try and dedicate themselves to an external cause, even if it is the future of the planet. By summarizing all of the points we have discussed this quarter in 1 video, however, it makes it easy for any individual to make changes in their lives by trying to implement some changes, and if they are further intrigued then the other, more in-depth videos are great for them. From my observations on people's perceptions towards climate change, a big percentage of people are somewhat interested in the cause and aren't opposed to some changes, but find it far too complicated to try and get into if they dont have the time for it. Things like taking the train or biking instead of driving are environmentally conscious, but society as of now requires one to be efficient in order to pay the bills. A total systemic change is needed to shift the focus from efficiency to sustainability and welfare, so that capitalistic side-effects like climate change are reduced and we as a people can work on implementing changes that will not only alleviate climate change but also help us lead happier, healthier lives. In the film happy, for example, the people of Denmark used co-housing as a solution for greater community and sustainability, but that would never work in America unless a serious cultural shift was to happen. I think for anything substantial to happen, we as the human race need to fight for the earth through policy change, and enacting rules and regulations that can allow the planet to heal. Once it becomes a part of our culture, people will naturally gravitate towards things like smaller homes and sustainable transportation as those are more favorable in terms of the emotional response we get from them(happiness, satisfaction, etc).

I really enjoy the video. Before taking this class, I thought this class will not change me at all. But, indeed, at the end of the course, I realize it does impact me. Now, every time when I do things, I first think about how much emission this will cause. What changed me the most is the idea of “minimalism”; I have barely bought things since I watched the video, and I do think it makes my life much easier, while contributing less emissions at the same time. Mitigating climate change has become a thing for me, and I’ll definitely keep this mindset up especially when I have learned 20 more solutions. It’s our responsibility to save the earth for us and future generation, so let’s start from our lives and make this world a better place to live.

I have taken both Eng22 and Eng23 in two semesters. I feel I learned a lot on the factors which cause climate crisis and the solutions we can take to save the planet. I am appreciate that I watched these videos and got educated. Through the course, we talked about the factors on clothing, food, housing, transportation, etc which contribute the emission of greenhouse gases. They are listed in this video as 20 things we can do to save the planet. They let me to see more possible solutions I can do to reduce the CO2 emission. In summary, I am able to buy less unneeded staff, live in a small house, try to consume less beef and do not waste food; also, I will not own a car and I transport by bus and train. I will also try to reduce the times of flying, which contributes a lot on climate crisis. I believe my generation is easy to take an action. Another job gave us is to educate our parents and grandparents on the seriousness of the climate crisis and tell them what they can do in their daily life. I think we should influence them and bring them to the actions to lower the climate footprints. The second ten things on the list is related to political actions such as voting. Voting is far more influential than any other actions on the climate crisis because the government will create policies to make a change and prevent releasing more greenhouse gases. I think this video summary the main idea, which is the best part, of the course. As the global temperature has increases by two degrees, we should gather not only taking the personal actions but telling the rest of the world the current situation by our own power.

I appreciate this video because it summarizes everything we have learned and continues to give me ideas of how I can make a difference. Before starting this course, I did not believe that one person could make a difference, I felt that regardless of my actions, others are doing worse to the environment and my small changes would not make a difference. For example, the amount of things I buy are minimal to those that celebrities buy and waste. However, this class has given me a very different perspective, because I should not be focusing on what others are doing but instead on making my own life changes and encouraging those around me to do the same. I now feel much more educated and empowered to make a difference. While I have always believed in climate change, this class helped me understand the crisis and gave me a sense of urgency that although it sometimes scares me it also motivates me. We have no time to waste, and I am very capable of doing most of the examples Ken gave, because it is the right thing to do. Ever since I started taking this class, I realized how the solutions are always in the back of my mind and have stopped me from buying unnecessary things, or using my car when I know I don't really need to. I am glad and thankful for the self awareness that this class has given me.

I really love this video made by Ken, Like I have said before, Ken's video can always give me some new ideas. I learned many things from his video and lecture. One of the important thing is that we don't have to do something big to achieve this goal. For example, drive less and ride more bike or bus. save water resource, and buy more e-book instead of using paperback books. Ken also lists many ways to teach us to save our environment, I heard that Ken ride bike for three days to travel to another city. I was inspired and touched by his actions. Many people always teach people to do something, but they don't even think to make a change.

What a wonderful way to encapsulate this course. I really love this video. Ken, I can confidently say you have successfully and forever changed the lives of everyone in this class. I believe this course should be a requirement for everyone at UCSB. This is the most important issue in our society and you have single handedly educated us above and beyond expectations. To see all 20 things we can do to save the planet in one place is overwhelming but I believe that eventually we can get there. You have not only motivated us but you have given us the tools to succeed and change the world as we know it. This is an amazing summary for all people in and out of this class. This class has been incredibly inspiring and I am so thankful for everything I have learned and the personal growth I have encountered. I hope to take more of your classes in the future.
<br><br>
The climate crisis is bigger than all of us alone but if we work together I believe we can save our planet.

I will be forever grateful to have been a part of this class, and I definitely agree with you on the point that every student at UCSB should take this course. Though it may sound dramatic, throughout these ten weeks Ken has managed to change around 900 students’ lives. He planted a seed of hope and perseverance in each of us, which I hope will cultivate into a new generation of climate activists. 
 <br><br>
Though I was feeling helpless throughout the first half of this course, Ken reassured me that there is always a way to get involved and make a lasting difference no matter how small the act is. It was astonishing that he was able to compile a list of 20 rather simple ways to save our planet. I am now more determined than ever to start making more and more changes moving forward, and if enough of our classmates do this, we will be able to make a much larger impact. I hope Ken is able to teach this class as frequently as he can because this was truly a life-changing class, and many more people should become exposed to this.

While we have heard most (if not all) of these solutions in this course already, it's very useful to have a list all at once that's easy to access and explains everything pretty well in terms that most people can understand. This video can be used not only for everyone taking the course, as a cap off and study guide, but it can be given to people who don't have the time to go through and spend hours upon hours reviewing everything about climate change to find out how they can help. Now, if anyone I know is curious as to what they can do, I can easily point them here, and they can have it all figured out within a half hour. 
<br><br>


What I also appreciate about this video is that it makes everything sound so simple, and in reality, most of it is. Other sources often over complicate things, or go too far and enter the realm of impossibility, or other things like that. This video is easy to follow and is descriptive in things that almost everyone can do, as well as giving a solid range if you can do more. It really is extremely helpful to everyone, and I trust that using it we will have many people cut down on their carbon footprint by quite a bit. I personally am excited to start incorporating many of these into my everyday life.

This final video for the class was a very nice way to end the class. It summed up the main points of the class and it will allow future students and viewers outside of the class for a quick way to learn about how lifestyles can be changed to deal with climate change. It depends on the action that you can take that will affect how the climate will be years from now. After taking english 22 and now english 23, I loved how much I was able to learn about the climate and the culture and action that is involved with it. I now feel more inclined to talk to people about climate change not just when it is brought up, but when I bring it up on my own to others when I see there is an easy fix. It is important to understand both sides of the climate change battle, the social and scientific parts of it. By understanding everything there is to know about a topic, like that of climate change, there is no way we can go about it truly wrong. We have the correct information and sources to provide others to become knowledgeable on the climate crisis, and we have the resources to make change in the world. This video is a great way to show others that can and must take action against climate change. It is very doable to change each other's lives to help the earth in the long run. By doing this, we help ourselves in the long run as well.

I really enjoyed this class and have felt the evolution of the course reflected in my mindfulness for the planet, as well as in the ease I feel. I think that the accessibility of this class has been the most important part, as education will probably give us the best change. I think this video is a great starter video to give to my friends or people who are less educated on the climate crisis. It gives you things you can do immediately, as well as things you can start planning to do, or working into your life style. I think the spread of these videos is important and will impact anyone who watches them.

Ken's talk video works superbly of simply that. I have an inclination that I have picked up so much significant information from this class and it has been completely motivating to be encompassed by and speak with a gathering of similar friends. I was additionally to some degree amazed to perceive how predominant democratic is in the rundown that dynamic political investment can assume a huge job in diminishing carbon outflow and sparing our condition as naturally cognizant government officials will advocate for laws and strategies expected to address environmental change, for example, guidelines on the constraints of carbon emanation considered petroleum product organizations and across the country usage of reusable force sources in both open offices and private homes. 
   <br><br>
            I figure everyone could in the end discover something on this rundown of 20 things to continually lessen their carbon impressions and produce advantages to the earth. I truly appreciated this video since like Ken stated, if we somehow managed to show only one of his talks to family or friends, it would be this one. I agree with him since he gives an extensive rundown of what we have realized, however what we should detract from this class. I believe it's significant that information itself isn't power in the event that it isn't trailed by activity. 
<br><br>
        The current week's small scale address, "20 things that every one of us can do to spare the planet", is built up to wrap up the entire course of English 23 and is incredibly educational so we could experience it and reinforce our insight on this class. Ken isn't just concentrating on an individual level, which implies everyone that is watching this video could follow his lead and begin to make changes.
<br><br>
       I represent the vast majority of the class when I state that I can see myself finishing most, if not all, of the means that Ken gave us. A portion of these changes will be troublesome and will set aside some effort to become accustomed to, however I accept that following these means is not even close to inconceivable. The best test truly is the change based on what we're doing now to changing to a planet-sparing way of life.

After watching this video and other assignments from this week, I learned that leading a simple life with simple, but efficient ways can definitely lead to a better life. There are many options in life that people can adapt in their lives and sometimes those adaptations can help the environment to become a better place. If people start to understand more about these options and how these can become the motivations for other people to create a better environment, we can seriously make a huge change for this planet. I learned many things from this class and I'm very glad that I took it. before I barely knew the hardships our planet was going through and was sometimes misinformed about certain things. However, after taking this class, I am very inspired and motivated to become a better contributor to the needed change.

Simplicity means different things to different types of people. I agree that a simple life is a better life, though. Whatever that means to you or to me, I hope that we both can reach the goal of living a simpler life. I loved your comment because it made me realize that a lot of people our age care about saving our planet. I also feel very inspired and motivated.

This lecture video is probably my favorite video out of all the lecture videos we've watched so far. It summarizes the entire course so deeply and effectively as well. Ken goes over 2 lists in this video - 1 with cultural/personal actions we can take and 1with political actions. 

<br><br>

First, I wanted to talk about list 1 (cultural and personal actions) 
<br><br>
Throughout this course, I have learned the importance of every single one of these actions and why we should do it and what it would affect. For example, the one with biking will reduce CO2 emissions vs. driving a car. Buying fewer clothes will emit less waste and thus fewer factories and in turn,  less CO2 emissions. Each of these actions has a reason and it may seem as if we are going back in time (bike vs. car) but if we want to save our earth, it is really the only option. I feel that many of these things are definitely doable but also looked down upon in our society and culture. For example, clothing brands are constantly advertising their new clothing line or clothing season but if you were you live a minimalistic life and only have 30 clothing items... society looks down upon you for not owning a lot of things. In our society, the more things you own = the amount of success and money you have. Which is completely false. Actually, by buying fewer things, you are actually saving up your money. 

<br><br>

Second, going off the 2nd list (political actions)
<br><br>
I loved how Ken mentioned that voting and taking political action is just as important. We do live in a democracy and if our voice isn't being heard then nothing will happen. Just this past week, on March 2nd was voting day for many things. On-campus, on social media, in classrooms, people were promoting the essence of voting. I'm proud to say that I did vote and hopefully made a change. I voted for those who are undocumented and aren't able to. I voted for those who are in developing countries, who only emitted 5% or less to our carbon footprint as human-kind. I voted for our planet. 

<br><br>

In all, this video hits deep because I truly think that if every single person in the world can adopt just a few of these actions, maybe there will be hope for our planet after all.

I completely agree with the two different types of actions we can take both personal and political in order to save our planet for ourselves and future generations. but it is imperative we recognize science as the driving force that has led all of human history, society only progressed to where we are today because of our ability to think and come up with a solution to any problem we faced. Our evolution is defined by our ability to think and bend the very laws of nature to power the machines and information systems that define our life. 
<br><br>


Our blatant disregard for science in this class is extremely disturbing, I recognize my biases as a stem major but I think that I still have made a relatively good case. 
<br><br>


But good comment! and here's to saving the earth through any method possible!!




</span></div><hr>


<p>
From my personal perspectives, I am more determined to make changes to our Earth, to climate change. Among those 20 solutions, I found that they are all compelling to us, not only to the students of Eng23, but also for all humans around the world. Even some of the solutions we have seen them for a thousands of times, but they are truths. Moreover, despite eating vegetables, consuming less meat, milk and taking bike to schools, there are many other ways that can save our Earth. moreover, if someone ask me the best video to telling my friends about how to solve climate crisis, then this is the one. This video is extremely inspiring and compelling, and making us more willing and motivated to make some changes to our home, to our Planet.

Ken’s lecture video for week 9 was a great review for the entire course. The list of 20 things we can do is a very good starting point for anyone who wants to being combating the climate crisis. Of course on person cannot do it alone and our whole generation has to put in an effort to stop it but I truly think it is possible. Out of the entire list, my favorite voting for environmental initiatives because I personally think this is one of the best ways to get these ideas to the people who can make the biggest change. As we have learned through out the course an individual can only do some much when it comes to something like the climate crisis and instead we must all band together to stop it. Overall, this course taught me so much about what is actually going on with the climate crisis and what we need to do to stop it which I think is very important in the fight to stop climate change.

In this lecture, Prof. Hiltner told us the 20 ways to both individually and collectively address the climate change. For me, I realized that, first and foremost, I need to vote. I need to vote for candidates that take the Green New Deal into consideration which might be Bernie Sanders as those who are in charge are the ones who have the most powerful. Next, I can use electric bike that does not cause carbon emission when riding from downtown Santa Barbara to UCSB. Last but not the least, I can live in a big city which will reduce my personal carbon emission.

This video serves as an excellent comprehensive review of the topics we have covered that contribute to our carbon footprint, that can also be modified or eliminated to reduce the impact that we have. While for much of the course we simply learned about the problems, we are finally at the point where the focus has shifted to what we can do about these problems. Many of the solutions rely on political change, whether that be through our votes or other forms such as civil disobedience. In order to create change you have to be a big enough force that there is no choice, but to accommodate these needs. As a more developed country, we and those countries similar to us have a heightened responsibility to solve these issues because we were principally the ones who created them, or at least made them drastically worse. In the early stages of this class the future of our planet seemed very grim, but now that we know why these problems are occurring and some of the things we can do, I am much more optimistic for the future, or at least much more optimistic that we have the knowledge to save the planet. Implementing these changes is the part I am less optimistic about and hope we will not be too late, or later than we already are.



</p><hr>


<p>
I thought it was very helpful to separate the list into 10 individual things and 10 things based on other people. It was a good review and way to explain what we can do about the climate crisis in a short amount of time.




</p><hr>


<p>
After watching this week’s lecture video, I found that I am more motivated to make some changes and more determined to be a climatarian. The reason is that Ken provides a myriad solutions to us such as purchasing products which produced by environmentally friendly companies and creating powerful groups of activists that can make changes to our environment and so on. Instead of providing simple solutions like taking bikes to schools and eat vegetable, I think these are more convincing and more motivated for us to reduce the severity of climate change and protect our Earth. Moreover, since we have put those undeveloped countries into suffering, we have responsibility to pull them out.

This week’s lecture video made me feel more motivated to make changes in my life as well. Laying out 20 examples of where to start in order to save the planet makes the solutions much more tangible and attainable. I especially want to make an impact by becoming a climatarian. I already don’t waste food, which I can attribute to the way my parents raised me. It makes such a big difference because of the significant portion of carbon emissions that comes from meat, buying produce out of season, and wasting food. Because of our immense contribution to the climate crisis, we should definitely take responsibility for our actions. Less developed countries feel the impact at a much larger degree than more developed countries. We need to take all of the steps possible to help mitigate the climate crisis and begin to save the planet.

I really appreciated the lecture video this week. It was nice to have a comprehensive list of everything we've gone over for the quarter on how we can personally make efforts to help the climate crisis, as well as collective action that can be done. I've always been someone who cared about the planet, but I can honestly say I haven't been doing my full part. There's always more I can be doing to help the planet, and though I think I've taken huge steps in the right direction, I can push it more. This list was a nice reminder of the ways that I can do my part more.

<br><Br>
I have become fully vegetarian this quarter, after not eating red meat for about a year, and I can honestly say that it really hasn't been hard. I can see myself going vegan or maybe freegan if that's better at some point in my life. I'm currently trying to balance my personal needs with the planet's, because I'm trying to do my part slowly so I can fully commit rather than jumping in with both feet just to give up a week later. I know we're running out of time, though, which is what scares me. Also, another food related thing is that I try really hard not to waste food. I always have but I'm far more conscious of it now. It's definitely hard to do in the dining hall as I know that lots of that food goes to waste, and I wish there was a way around that, and it may be something I look into in my future years here at UCSB.

I share your sentiments about feeling like you haven’t done your full part. I’ve always felt guilty for not doing enough even though I’ve always been aware of certain environmental issues. I feel that many people also relate to this sentiment, but this class has definitely helped to push me forward with attempting to reduce my impact on this planet. When I wonder what was stopping me before, I feel like it’s an odd combination of a bystander effect and feeling helpless with matters pertaining to the environment. I also wasn’t completely sure how to do my part despite doing some research. However, thanks to this class (and specifically this video), I know what more I can do going forward.

Even though there are 20 things we can do, besides technology solutions, the feasible solutions for international students like me are actually limited. These 10 solutions Ken mentioned in this lecture, most of them are about voting. But as an international student, I cannot vote. Therefore I can't choose a candidate that supports the Green New Deal. I think the only thing I can do is tell my friends and parents eating meat, especially beef, driving cars, and fly by air is bad for our environment since it can release tons of CO2. After taking this course, I understood many ways that I can do as a tiny part of the earth to save our planet. Even though I can't save, I can still slow down the climate crisis, and I believe I will continue to try my best to do it.

<p>
Though the things said in this lecture were basically a review of the past few weeks, it was still nice to hear them again. And, while I do agree that we should do all we can to follow these guidelines, I think that Professor Ken is perhaps too idealistic in one way: that voting should only take up about an hour of your time each year. Perhaps the physical act of going to the polling station and casting your vote will take only an hour but I truly hope that people will take more than an hour to research what they are voting for. There is more than just climate activism to vote for (this is not to say climate activism is not extremely important), we should all be taking time to look at the candidates and propositions that are on the ballot. If you do not, you risk voting for things (laws, people, acts) that would not actually be ideal for our society and planet. So yes, VOTE but also please take more than an hour to do so, research and take your time. Overall, I have really enjoyed learning how I can enact change and help the climate and I do appreciate this list.

One thing that really stood out to me in Ken's lecture above was the fact that changing to a plant based diet can help reduce CO2 emissions far more than solar panels on a home and whatnot. I never really thought about it that way since I never paid attention as to how the meat I've been consuming is transported via aircraft which is obviously contributing to the climate crisis at an extreme rate and severity. I've had a certain concern for some time now; why don't we come together and fight climate crisis considering it's for our own good?! If we don't take care of our earth now, there won't be an earth to take care of quite soon. On another note, I personally disagree with the claim and suggestion to limit the amount of children each household raises. So many religions (including mine) convey the importance of reproducing and how it is our purpose in life. If a large family lives an eco-friendly lifestyle, there is no problem with the household consisting of several children. If a couple has one child, but have horrible daily habits, then what's the point of limiting how many kids you have?

This class brought up a whirlwind of emotion in me! At the beginning of the class, when learning about the environmental problems happening in the world today, I felt very hopeless. However, as the class went on and we began talking about personal action and governmental action I became way more hopeful! I'm optimistic about our future and I'm excited to become even more environmentally conscious in how I live my life. Also I think UCSB should make this class a requirement for all students!

I agree with this comment and especially that UCSB should make this a requirement for all students--or at least some type of climate change class as it would be very beneficial and open many students eyes as it did for me. This video was awesome because it nicely laid out 10 individual actions and 10 political and collective actions that can all be used for the benefit of saving the planet. I also do like that Ken mentioned we are not really “saving” the planet from something that we shouldn’t have seen coming. In short, we are saving the planet from the damage we already caused, saving the planet from ourselves, for ourselves rather. My biggest takeaways are that it is not only important to consider a plant based diet, but to be a climatarian so that you can actually investigate the climate impact foods have rather than just committing to plants. For example, asparagus is just as bad as chicken climate-impact-wise in the winter in North America due to the distance traveled to get the asparagus here. On the lines of food--we need to watch out for food waste and be using what we buy--and not buy in excess. I remember from an earlier video Ken talked about eating beet leaves in salads and how pickled watermelon rinds are snacks in other regions. These examples alone show that we can get creative with our food to not waste so much. Additionally, I now understand that fracking is a huge if not the biggest issue we need to resolve which can be done so through many of the political / collective activism suggestions Ken makes. We need to not only exercise our right to vote--but actually vote for candidates that are committed to sweeping climate change. I also know that contraception is a huge deal and the education of girls and boys from a young age is so important. Even more importantly is protecting a woman's choice and access to contraception/ decisions about her own body.

This lecture video was a perfect way to encapsulate all we’ve learned throughout the quarter. Yes, these were all points we’ve heard before, but watching them in a single video allowed me to realize just how doable these actions would be. Personally, I’m going to begin adopting a climatarian diet. While I’m already vegetarian, I want to start eating with the climate in mind, which means being aware of where my food is being sourced from, deliberately supporting local producers, and purchasing less processed and packaged food. While this is difficult to implement, I’m determined to do my part in helping the environment. 
<br><br>

I also want to begin purchasing less stuff, especially clothes. Since coming to college, this has happened accidentally due to the other places my money has to go to. Recently, I’ve been thrifting my clothes more often than buying from retail stores. After watching “The True Cost”, I was inspired to research fair trade (meaning ethical and sustainable) brands and only buy from them if I’m buying new apparel. Patagonia, Madewell, and Athleta are all commonly known and fair trade certified brands!

<br><br>

Lastly, one action I took (and hopefully a lot of us did) was vote in the primaries last week. I made sure to educate myself on the candidates and understand their stance on a multitude of issues, with a keen interest in where they stood in regards to climate change and any measures that they were taking to support the environment. This was the first election I could vote in, so I felt empowered by my actions and motivated to continue engaging in the politics of our country, especially regarding climate change.

I agree, though this video outlined aspects of the course that we've already explored, putting it into one video that summarizes the takeaways of this quarter helps put it all into perspective. I was thinking to myself, maybe Ken should have started the class with the video. Yet, I realized that it would be more beneficial for us to learn about each helpful action individually (hence the style and pace of this course) rather than just a brief quick summary. Not only does this video summarize action but it's a great tool to go back once we've completed this class and moved on with a greater knowledge, though all of the documentaries and everything we've watched will remain in my head for a long time. Still, it's a great refresher in case we're too caught up in our busy lives that we forget some parts.
<br><br>
But a lot of what we've learned in this class is unforgettable. For me at least, it's been a gradual change. I started buying a lot less, more aware of the cost of fast fashion. And turning 18 right before this important 2020 election in November, I can feel more assured in myself and my peers about the future of the Earth. We can all find somethings out of this list to do, prioritizing some more than others, and making a conscious choice having been through this course, and essentially having travelled around the world through the films we've seen to emphasize that we're not alone and we have to help each other.

So far I have learned a great deal about myself, my values, and how I am impacting and will impact the environment from this class and all of Ken’s lectures. Due to this class and the information we have been taught, I have already cut out red meat from my diet, started being more conscious about how I am traveling, cut out any unnecessary possessions, and have started communicating to my friends and family how their actions are impacting the environment. There are so many simple things in this video that should be common knowledge to all people, and I have made it a priority in my life to try and change how other people act and think when it comes to climate change. For example, my parents wanted to go to Hawaii during spring break to vacation as they haven’t been on one in 10+ years. Obviously getting there requires flying and a decent amount of money. But when I brought up to them how many emissions are produced from flying (something they are entirely ignorant of, but I won’t blame them for that) they were shocked to see how damaging a trip like that actually is to the environment. It only takes a simple conversation to give them the facts and change their minds about how they travel and will travel in the future. For now, I convinced them that going there wouldn’t be the best option, and they are considering other places in California that we could drive to instead and still enjoy the outdoors and have fun without blowing our carbon footprint even more than we already have. We all need to make these points Ken has laid out common-knowledge, and it starts by just pointing things out to other people. We don’t need to do it in an abrasive manner, but we do need to do it. We are the generation that will fix this planet and put it on the road to recovery. It all starts with us acting on the knowledge we have been given.

Hey! I am actually experiencing the same thing as you. I have also been avoiding meat completely! I try to avoid many other types of animal foods and have implemented more tofu, rice and beans.I have decided to no longer travel and have decided to purchase used clothing. This class has opened my eyes and has taught me what truly is valuable and that is the planet.  I agree that a conversation is enough to try to convince people. My parents were also not knowledgeable about the climate crisis. They did not know anything about it. But I talked to them one night and on the phone. I told them to stop eating meat and told them why. I summarized the readings that ken has given us, to them. they were also shocked and could not believe the damage. My mote=her is now very concerned about the situation and has decide to change what food she cooks. My dad has also agree since he thinks it will be a healthier lifestyle for him. I think that we should all listen to the teaching resources that ken has provided. We should spread this information to more schools and to more young since as young kids they can grow knowing what's the right thing to do and will adapt more easily to change. I truly think that everything is possible.

It's been quiet the journey this quarter. Watching "Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet" was an amazing look back on all the take aways from this class.  I loved how Ken expressed the importance of being able to talk about this issue with others. Often when people look at the climate change crisis, they think of never eating meat again or using a car and basically being a hippie; one can forget how much power there is (going back to Ken's knowledge schtick) in the information we have absorbed this quarter. The ability to share what we have learned with our family and friends, as said in solution 13, provides us with so much to give back towards the fight against the climate crisis. Now we may not be teaching hundreds of students about climate change 101, like the great Ken Hiltner, but even sharing our perspective and a call to action to someone next to you can bring about change. 
<br><br>

Coming to the end of the quarter and thinking about some of the changes I want to make individually, I'm still finding it hard to adopt a vegan-like diet. At this moment, it just simply seems unrealistic with my high protein diet and my love for meat. However, it is something I can work towards month by month, year by year, and hopefully one day fully adopt. This is where I begin to appreciate Ken's use of the word "climatarian." Do you care about the planet? Heck ya i do! From a business standpoint, it seems intuitive that trying to market climate change and fighting it to a broader audience is simply more appealing than trying to get people off meat and cars. Coming out of this class, I pledge myself to becoming a climatarian and practicing more and more of the solutions stated in Ken's video. 
<br><br>

To end off, I wanna stress one final call to action. Whether or not you believe in a plant-based diet, a minimalistic approach, slow travel, or even contraceptives, I want people to believe in the power of their VOTE. VOTE! VOTE! VOTE! Not only does it give you a sense of patriotism and purpose to this country, but benefits the people of today, tomorrow and generations to follow.

I agree that learning the ability to communicate the climate crisis is one of the most enlightening solutions that we’ve learned this quarter. A significant portion of my family is pretty conservative, and I’m sure that climate change almost never crosses their mind, and I feel equipped to discuss climate change with them and hopefully change the way they view their everyday consumption of resources.  And I too, am looking back on the material that we’ve discussed in class and directly applying these solutions to how I will live my life in the future. One thing that I can do to reduce my own climate footprint is to buy less stuff. I love fashion, makeup and all that girly shit that no one really needs. But I really, truly want to shift my buying habits, making much less purchases, buying used items, and maybe even learning to sew so that I can both fix my old clothing items and upcycle new ones. Another thing that I feel very passionate about is getting more politically active in my community. I was so sure that Bernie would be our next president, that society has finally opened their eyes, and that we were finally ready for a revolution. But now, I’m not so sure, seeing how so many democrats voted for Joe Biden instead of Bernie really showed me how naive I was so think that American’s were ready for change. Nothing will change until Americans see that they have no other choice, that the planet is dying and that their lives and the lives of their children will be dramatically changed by climate change. We do need to become the climate vanguard and to insist that things change, we really are our planet’s only hope for the future.

I really enjoyed Ken's video.  The video nicely sums up the steps each person could take to make a difference in the climate crisis.  After learning more about the negative effects of the climate crisis and viewing the way many people choose to be selfish with their actions, I have lost a lot of hope in how this issue will get resolved.  Ken's video honestly opens my eyes to realize that individual action can make a difference to help solve the crisis little by little.  It is important to take a look at our daily actions and choose to change parts of our lifestyle little by little.  Many of the steps Ken talks about may seem unattainable, but we must slowly begin to change our ways of life.  I honestly believe that saving the planet is a collective effort, but that will only occur through individual actions.  To many people, the steps necessary to solve the climate crisis may seem too far-fetched.  I believe that we must change our wasteful habits and consumerist way of life to slowly make a difference and truly be happy with the way we are living in terms of caring for our planet.

I find it funny that this list of 20 things can have such a huge impact. The idea that these things–that would arguably make you a happier person by contributing to a feeling of purpose and moral ease– could carry the weight in ensuring that the climate could be salvaged and maintained for future generations is almost unbelievable. Unbelievable in the sense that they are so simple and unbelievable in the sense that they seem nearly unachievable. I usually am more hopeful in the face of the climate crisis, but there are just so many people our there in the US and elsewhere tht just have no idea what their actions mean. 
<br><br>
I recently went to a birthday dinner for one of my long-time friends, there were a few people there from our high school. I was asked about my school experience and my life, so I updated them, and the responses of these people blew my mind. I know that I am actually recieving an education in environmental studies, but the fact that we ARE in the midst of the climate crisis, that we are all from CA, that they also moved to a location close to the ocean, but still weren't sure about climate change, and were still using plastic water bottles on the daily– shocking. I have gotten so used to this glorious bubble of educated college students that are going vegetarian or vegan for the climate– that dinner just reminded me that most people are like that. This list of 20, completely do-able, things seems so out of reach. I am actively trying to turn this pessimism into action. I want to make my doubts the reason that I try even harder to communicate, to be an activist, to take personal action. I know that there are people out there that still need to be reached– we can reach them, but we have to get out of this comfortable bubble where everyone is already aware.

This was a cool video and I am definitely going to utilize it in preparation for the final exam. I loved how Ken tied everything together in this one video summarizing the most important points of the course as it is the blueprint of what we need to do with our futures. What continues to fascinate me in this course is how much we waste in food. Food waste continues to bother me because we have this blessing of food on our plates while so money others around the world don't and instead of working to feed them we throw our food away. The right to nourishment to me is just a basic human right as it is one of the building blocks to life which I also believe is just a basic human right, and there are so many people in this world who dit know where their next meal will come from and then we go ahead and waste 40% of our food. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this video and it serves not only as a study tool but as a wonderful guide

I also enjoyed this video and viewed it as a solid summary especially because it emphasized the interconnectedness of all of these issues. I appreciate that Ken repeatedly emphasizes the importance of understanding the relative impact of different solutions as it allows us to act accordingly and to interact critically with media as climate activists. This is particularly relevant with the issue of food waste. I am also very interested in and surprised by the issue especially because of how underrepresented it is. I understand now that addressing the issue of food waste would be more environmentally beneficially than generally switching to plant-based diets, yet we hear so much more about the latter. The food waste issue is frustrating because of its damaging effects on the planet and also because it appears to represent such an imbalance while the privileged waste perfectly good food and hungry people go without food. All of the issues and solutions we have explored in this course are so interconnected and so many of them turn out to be "win, win, win[s]," as Ken says. The climate crisis is an opportunity to address so many issues.

<p>
I really like the concept of this week’s lecture video, Ken has once again done an outstanding job in putting climate crisis and how we should deal with it in a nutshell. Among all the twenty things that he mentioned, I find the concept of ‘read and educate yourself about skills you can take on’ to be necessary in pairing up for the concept ‘think about why this is so important in order to maintain or revitalize your passion for the cause’, everything else will fall in place once we naturally follow these concepts. I truly believe that if we all educate ourselves in regards with this climate crisis, we will solve this issue. However, just as seen in previous lecture videos and throughout the course, not everyone will actually prioritize climate crisis in their lives. Thus, concept #17 of realizing how vital the climate crisis is to us and to our future generation should be taken seriously. Personally, this lecture video has provided a good summation of what the climate crisis is and how we should deal with it. The last concept is truly self-reflecting because I often fear the idea of the world ending once I achieved and accomplished what I want to be. I learned so much in the past 8-9 weeks, it has successfully awakened the environmentalist inside me, making me worried about the world more and its current state. Hence, the last concept of the video about becoming the change I want to be to see in the world.

Agreed. This week's lecture nicely summarizes the list of many actions we can take individually and collectively to reduce emissions and effectively battle the climate crisis. Although it may not be easy, if we were all to take the time to educate ourselves on the effect that every one of our actions have on the planet, we wouldn't make the many selfish decisions we usually make virtually every day. It is true that most of us will stay oblivious to the damage we are continuously inflicting upon our surrounding environment, but hope still remains. The last concept of becoming the change we want to see in the world also hits home for me because like you, I fear of dying before I realize the impact that I've made in the world, whether be on a relatively small scale like within my own life or that of friends and family, or in a large scale (i.e. among the general public). Ken has done an incredible job of educating us on the very frightening reality that climate crisis is and ways in which we can avoid life-threatening catastrophes.

This video was very informative and a great way to sum up the teachings of the class. I think the thing I liked best was Ken’s acknowledgement of the necessity for both individual change and collective action. So often I feel like people simply do nothing to change their personal consumption habits because they see it as pointless. They believe that the corporations and politicians hold too much power for anything to be done by the people. I think that this is naive and allows too much complacency in light of such a large issue that will affect all of us. 
 <br><br>

I also liked how Ken mentioned that individual actions alone will not do enough to stop the imminent crisis. I think this is important because it recognizes the privilege dynamics of the current economic and social system we have globally. Collective action provides a way for those that are privileged to stand up for those who are not but also allows for those we do not have the time or money to engage in personal change to do things that are free such voting. 
<br><br>
Moreover, there is no way we can tackle the issue we have put ourselves into without changing our personal behaviors while also working together to make this cultural change accessible for all.

I agree that collective climate activism is a large steppingstone towards the reconstruction of a greener world. Getting political activists to endorse companies and legislation that prevents further damage to the atmosphere is a top priority for all inhabitants of earth. Ken’s video really encompasses all of the ways that we as individuals can help reduce our personal carbon footprint into a neatly organized video, highlighting food consumption and production and addressing the issue of food waste, which acutely affects American consumers. Around one third of our food, completely edible and potentially dangerous exhibitors of methane gas into the atmosphere are thrown into landfills, unable to biodegrade, this food will remain a problem unless we can contrive a solution to combat this wasteful system. Sharing the invaluable information about climate control and prevention/ reduction of our personal actions to inhibit greenhouse growth. Much of the public is under the impression that the climate problem is not as large an issue as it is. The general public need to see videos like these because although they may feel that the effects of climate change are a problem for another generation, we are seeing record weather patterns and unrelenting acidification of the ocean, causing millions of animals to become extinct every year. Travel is a hard issue for us to tackle, most people who can fly to places probably will, their footprints will be larger than most and equally hard to cover up. Public transportation is an easily fixable issue, we need to adopt a culture similar to that of japan’s public transportation system, the investment into reliable, cheap transportation will attract folks of all types of backgrounds while also reducing the carbon footprint of all participants of public transportation.

I really like how you were able to encapsulate the entirety of the class in 20 main points in just one video. The video touches on each one for just over a minute each and provides the main points that we need to know. I think you did a great job of being clear and concise, providing relevant examples such as Greta and her initial actions for the well being of the world. Overall, I think that points 4 and 12 are the two most important points you made. Educating fairly is an issue that we have around the world and if we are able to equally educate both men and women, then we can tackle this a much higher rate. I think that yes we need to educate and we need to do it sooner. If we bring generations with the right mindset into the adult world time and time again, eventually climate awareness would be the global norm. Back to point 12, electing officials is so very important as well. We as individuals have the power to change our own lifestyles, but if policy doesn't change it would be for nothing. Great video ken and I can't wait to hear what comments are up for lecture!

Same same. Personally, education is key. A lot of the people who don't believe in global warming and the overall crisis are people who are generally not fully educated on the topic. For example, this class has actually helped me be more self-aware on certain things. I am trying my best to not eat that much meat, but it is difficult. I also learned how detrimental "fast-fashion" can be. And as annoying and redudant it may be, VOTE VOTE VOTE. Political officials are the ones with the true power for change.

This is probably my favorite lecture video by Ken. It does exactly as Ken says and wraps everything we learned in this course into a relatively short, concisely-put video. It provides us with the most significant takeaways from class and refreshes us with all the steps we can take to move towards an environmentally sustainable lifestyle.

 <br><br>

I think I speak for most of the class when I say that I can see myself completing most, if not all, of the steps that Ken provided us. Some of these adjustments will be difficult and will take time to get used to, but I believe that following these steps is nowhere near impossible. The greatest challenge really is the transition from what we’re doing now to switching to a planet-saving lifestyle. Personally, I haven’t made any significant changes in my life, and I feel guilty for that because I constantly justify myself by coming up with reasons such as “I’m busy with school” or “How can I live without In N Out burgers?” But I know that I can start making changes today, and so can the rest of us. 
 <br><br>


I’ve learned so much throughout the past eight weeks, and I hope the knowledge that the 800+ students in this course have acquired will soon turn into the power we are capable of having.

This was my favorite video from the quarter as well. It summed up everything we learned and the ways that we can decrease our climate footprint and now it is truly in our hands. Ken did not run this class for the sake of giving us 4 university credits, but as an opportunity to reach 800 plus potential climate change activists. We now are educated and informed on the subject, and in my opinion, have an obligation to turn our knowledge into action. I can also see myself making changes and taking those steps Ken mentioned. Because of this class, I can check multiple things off of the "20 ways to save the planet checklist". Because of this class I have become vegetarian, am aware of my food waste, am cautious on the effects of what I buy, voted in the primary, got my 2 roommates to register to vote, and have communicated with friends and family about the crisis we are facing.
 <br><br>

My favorite part of the video was that Ken repeated "saving the planet begins with BLANK" before listing each step. It was repetitive and redundant, but that's the point. It is going to take a lot of time, a lot of effort, and a lot of persistence if we want to make a difference for our planet. Saving the planet begins with all 20 of these things, because just doing a few is not good enough at this point. We, as educated and able Americans, need to be setting the tone with what the future is going to look like for our planet. I took this class for a GE and came out with knowledge far beyond the classroom. It is now up to me and my classmates to make sure the knowledge is not squandered, but indeed power.


<br><hr>
I totally resonate with your comment about justifying apathetic behavior with “being too busy.” I find myself doing this all the time and after this class I am definitely going to check myself whenever I make this justification in my head. My personal businesses has nothing to do with the betterment of the planet for all creatures. When I put it into perspective, my upcoming bio midterm or English paper is completely insignificant compared to the enormity of the climate crisis. Unfortunately, I see many people our age making these kinds of justifications for their behavior. After reading Kalmus though, I finally truly realize that we have no excuse. It doesn’t actually take that much more time to live a sustainable life, and it is better for us and the planet. 
 <br><br>

Overall I really appreciate Ken’s list and the work he has put into this course. I now am much more knowledgeable about how to best reduce my emissions in my own life. I will definitely try to pass this knowledge onto more of my friends and family. I think more lists and initiatives like this have to be put into the public’s hand. A big problem in my eyes is that most people are aware of the climate crisis but see it as too big of an issue for them to personally do anything about. If it was made clear to more people in these kinds of lists, that don’t just say to change your light bulbs and take shorter showers, then a greater percentage of our world would feel empowered to make a change.

This week’s lecture is one of Ken’s best, because I think this is the best video to send around, to share with any Uncle Petes in our lives, or anyone who is genuinely interested in getting to know more about the climate crisis.  I know that I have already shared this video around.  When it’s all stated out like this, these tasks that Ken is calling upon us to do: to vote for environmentally conscious candidates, to continuously educate yourself, to eat more plant based, these things don’t seem too difficult.  We can often get so lost in the seemingly unsolvability of the climate crisis, but looking at it like this, we can do it.  It takes individuals together to make a big change.  

 <br><br>

There are so many personal changes that we can all make in our lives, easy things that we can literally start putting into action right now.  I know that after this class, the biggest change in my own life coming from these lists that I am going to try and work on is buying mostly used/recyclable products.  It is so easy, especially as a low-budget college student, to get caught up in the fast fashion industry, but I know now that my impact can make a difference, and I need to use my actions as a tool to fight the climate crisis.  However, I must address the political action which Ken speaks of, because I feel that this is of equal if not higher importance.  It felt powerful to be able to vote for the first time this month, and to be able to vote in support of candidates who care for our environment.  This is what we need to do.  As young people we must cast our votes because we cannot allow our voices to be silenced.  We are the future, and we must speak for it.

<p>
This lecture was a solid review of all of the solutions covered in this course and left me with a sense of optimism as I look to fight the climate crisis in my personal life and as part of a collective. As Ken went through the first 10 solutions, I found myself thinking "okay, I can definitely make these changes". Food waste and consumption appear to be the most important things to watch out for in our personal lives, and I personally have already been wanting to make these changes. In the United States particularly, we believe that we always need to have more and own more than the person next to us, and this clearly needs to change if we want to help save our planet.
 <br><br>
Meanwhile, political change is also key, and there are steps that we can take to spark a large scale change. As Ken said, if there is only one thing that someone can do to combat the climate crisis, then they should vote. Fracking is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, more than beef, therefore more would be accomplished if we stop being so dependant on fracking. This can be made possible with political changes such as voting on a local/national scale, and to research and vote for policies like the Green New Deal. It is truly inspirational to see such a collective change happen in places like Denmark, where biking is now the most popular mode of transportation. Such a large reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would not happen if it were not for the assembly of local communities calling upon their politicians to make the streets of Denmark more bike-friendly. Although the United States is a much larger country, I hold some optimism that a similar change could take place.
 <br><br>
As this course comes to a close, I am both more panicked and hopeful for the future. Ken has shown me the gravity of this crisis that we are all in, but he also taught me that there are concrete solutions and it is not too late to make changes. Some changes are personal, and some are political, but regardless of the scale of change, it of course all starts with us.

The lecture certainly felt slightly repetitive, but in a good way as it meant I have been paying attention to class. I felt as you did that I certainly could make the changes suggested in my own life, even though it may not be easy. My favorite solution was #20 -to become the change you want to see in the world. This I think is a superlative solution to the rest and empowers people to actually do the other 19, as when people want to see people change in the world so we may all save it, they will change themselves as well. Since taking this class I have certainly felt as you do that you want to reduce your consumption and waste, and I have made steps to reduce my consumption now and will continue to in the future. I will vote as well for climate change mindful initiatives and politicians. We must not be so dependent on fracking, work towards initiative like the Green New Deal. We all must find ways to not emit so many greenhouse gases, if we are to save the world. I feel as you do, both panicked and hopeful, as I feel like we are almost too far gone to save the planet, but hopeful as people care so much and may actually work to turn it all around. There are solutions like the 20 Ken listed, and if properly executed, we may have a fighting chance for my kids to have kids.

I just posted this video on my facebook feed in the hopes that it will get spread around and hopefully reach even more people. I, like many others, found this video in particular to be inspiring. While it was absolutely essential to dive deeply into each aspect of the climate crisis one by one, it was refreshing to zoom out and see it all laid out in front of you. Although it is unlikely that I will be able to do all 20 things on this list, the class has certainly inspired me to change my lifestyle. Specifically, I 100% cut beef out of my diet and am working on phasing out other meats. I stopped buying from Amazon due to their disgusting treatment of their workers and the planet. And on the political side, I have become much more active about my role in this election cycle. Talking to voters in places like South Carolina and Alabama, it was abundantly clear how uninformed people are about this issue, but this class has helped me tremendously in terms of conveying this information in a digestible and clear way. On a similar note, if you have family living in any states that haven’t had a primary yet, remember that Joe Biden has said that he would never ban fracking. Bernie on the other hand has taken a strong stance on the issue and said he would definitively ban it. Bernie has also created his own green new deal that is incredibly thorough. He also stands against the beef industry (something no other candidate ever did) and has said he will regulate it heavily.

The lecture this week is like a summary of the former videos. It mentions all solutions that can be done by any person from simply changing the diet to being the change. When the professor Ken starts to talk about the 20 things, I believe that I am not the only one who counts on the solutions that I can make it. Number 16 and 18 are two important solutions for me. Since I can only tell or teach others how to be more environmental-friendly after learning from the knowledge, education is fairly crucial for people. The children nowadays should get more accurate information about the environment, the place they are living on. We are sure that no one wants to hear the complaint from the new generation about why we do nothing about the planet. People should begin the action as soon as possible.

In this week's lecture video, Ken did an amazing job of summarizing what we learned this past quarter. The way this video was structured makes it very easy to understand and follow. Before beginning this class, I thought that going vegan would be a good and easy way to mitigate the climate crisis due to watching cowspiracy last quarter. This obviously isn’t enough even if everyone became vegan, we need to cut back our food waste and watch what we eat and when we eat it. I enjoyed how this video was split into two parts; personal change and collective, political change. Up until recently, I never cared about politics nor wanted anything to do with it. Now, I am pushing my unmotivated friends and families to the polls trying to get them to vote alongside me. As a female, my only political views were focused on reproductive rights and women’s rights. Now knowing that educating women helps mitigate the climate crisis, I am more motivated to participate in activism. I think that to become proactive in activism, you have to be passionate about what you are fighting for and I think this class overall made me more aware and very passionate. I think this lecture would be what I would show others that might not believe in climate change or don’t know what to do about it. This gives them all the actions they can take and gives a little information about each. That way, they can see what their options are and can further research them. I think point twenty was my favorite and the most powerful. Like Ken said, “talk is cheap” and we cannot expect others to make a change in their lifestyles unless we do the same.

I really think that this lecture video put everything together in the best way for us to understand. We talked about both personal and collective actions we can take upon ourselves to save our planet and this video perfectly summarized it all. I think that although the film “Being the Change” did show me the great importance of personal change and how we can change the stigma towards not being able to truly make a difference through personal changes, I feel like the second 10 actions Ken listed can have a way more monumental effect on the planet if we all come together. Education is not something that we can easily get worldwide, which is very unfortunate because I see education as the first big step towards mitigating the climate crisis. Through the use of more contraceptives and family planning we can make the global population increase less than it has until now. As Ken mentioned, 85 million pregnancies are unwanted and 32 million of them result in births. In the United States half of pregnancies are not wanted. These statistics truly show the importance of education worldwide (not just in the developing world). Education will improve the lives of those in developing countries and here because it doesn’t only encompass family size, with education we can get much of the population that doesn’t have enough information about the climate crisis to see the importance of fighting for what is right. The political and collective actions we can take have to start somewhere, and with educating the world of the climate crisis, we can get there and find passionate people who will help the climate crisis movement grow so actual change can be attained. 

 <br><br>

With that being said, personal actions that we can take are also very important. The fact that if we as adults buy a new car every 11 years but never drive the cars, that would use all of our carbon allotment for our lives (leaving none left for other things such as our houses and food) is absurd to me. Although there was a movement away from cities in the past, the movement towards cities is growing and is showing how the younger generations are able to take this change personally and help the environment. This gives me hope for our future, because I see how passionate young people are about the environment. I truly think we can fix the climate crisis, but we just have to collectively work together to do so.

This video was a great summary/review of the course. I’ve said this in previous comments, but I love lists! It almost made me sad watching this video though, because it went through the basic things we learned in class, and I will miss this class so much! But 
 <br><br>
I was also enthusiastic to see how many of these changes I’ve already made in my life, all thanks to this class. 
 <br><br>

I’ve always hated food waste, and I now consider myself a climatarian. I’ve cut my beef consumption to almost nothing, because I always choose any other meat over it, and I try to eat a more plant based diet in general. I’ve also always supported family planning including accessible birth control and abortion, as well as education for all people especially girls. Unfortunately, I struggle with making the change to public transportation. Here at UCSB I always take the bus if I go off campus, but back in LA I am in cars every single day. My current home in LA and my dorm room are both very appropriate for the amount of people, and I see myself in a nice comfortable apartment or house in the future. I also admire people who live minimalist lives, and I don’t think I’m considered a minimalist but I definitely only buy what I need plus a bit more. I like how Ken notes minimalism is a first world solution to a first world problem, but should still be an encouraged way to live. I grew up repairing things and buying only what I need, and knowing how important it is to vote. I am very glad to say I voted in the primaries, and am proud of supporting a person who will do his best to save the planet. 
 <br><br>

Since the first week of class I’ve also been plausibly annoying all my friends with suggestions, facts, and videos about the climate crisis. I have not attended an actual march or protest yet, but I hope to do so in the future and I believe in the power of social media activism. Thanks to this class, I’ve been doing a lot of reading, rethinking, and sharing on the issue, and I’ve learned so much but by no means am I an expert, and I will do more reading in the future. I try to do as much as possible, and maybe to denialists I am perceived as “hypocrite” which I absolutely detest, but I am constantly trying to do more to help the planet, and I believe in the impact that small changes have on the environment.

I completely agree. Having the final comprehensive list of what needs to be done to help the environment is so great, yet reminds me that I will not be taking this class next quarter, which makes me sad. Because of this class, though, I am and will continue to live with implementing as many of these things as I can myself, and advocate for the others that are not solely on me. I too no longer eat beef, and I hardly eat dairy. I have basically become vegan from this class.
 <br><br>

Biking is another greatly important way of transportation to consider, which has lead me to appreciating my bike more and others that I see biking. In almost all aspects of my life, this class has helped me to live mindfully. I am now constantly using less electricity and overall wasting less. I have become very conscious of the things I do, and a lot of them, if not all of them, are on the list of what we can do for the environment. My change in lifestyle has even rubbed off on my friends. My roommates and I make sure to not waste food and use as little water and electricity as possible. We are constantly having conversations about the state of the environment and the upcoming election which may decide the fate of the planet. Overall, this list is so important for everyone to know and understand. 
 <br><br>

Ken makes this class very inspiring, and I think this is why so many of the comments are talking about the personal changes people have made. Ken makes it clear that changing your lifestyle to be environmentally friendly is the best thing you can do for yourself and the planet. I admire Ken for what he has done for me and the rest of the class, and I truly hope there are other people like him educating at other schools.

I thought this lecture was really good. It did an amazing job tying the whole course together into a condensed video. It was also really interesting to relearn everything from the whole course and realize the numerous things I have learned. For example before this course I thought personal solutions were turning the water off while brushing my teeth or getting energy efficient lights. Now I know I can make a huge difference by reducing food waste and eating more plant based. I had always known the costs of meat production and chose not to eat it because I do not like the taste, but now I know how horrible the out of season veggies or fruits can be. I never thought that the little sticker on my food saying my food has come from across the world has such a huge carbon footprint due to the transportation. 
 <br><br>

I also really liked how this lecture divided the 20 things everyone can do. I found it flowed really well due to this, each solution leading into the next one. I am motivated to keep fighting and educating people to vote and make their voices heard because like ken said we cannot stop fracking on personal choices. Another thing Ken mentioned that stuck with me was about minimalism when he stated, “A first world problem with first world solutions”. I feel like this quote is relevant to many of the solutions for the Climate Crisis as a whole. Like wasting food, due to our wealth we throw away perfect food. Along with this people argue which diet is the best and whether a person can live off of beans versus burgers (obviously I know society can). When in reality again there are starving people across the country who would take any food they could get. Throughout all of them I found myself hopeful. Each of the things seemed like something I could do along with my friends and family who would hopefully follow.

I enjoyed this lecture and also thought it was a great way to conclude this course. I appreciated how Ken divided his points into individual action and political/collective action, both of which are paramount to stop the climate crisis. During the first couple of weeks of this class (when we were reading David Wallace Wells and watching the documentary on Paradise fire) my one complaint was that the class was extremely disheartening and pessimistic. However, as the course progressed and we began to get into solutions I began to enjoy the course much more. The climate crisis went from being this unstoppable, monstrous disaster to something that could be stopped. 
 <br><br>


This video and list of actions to stop the climate crisis also made me optimistic and hopeful for the future. When I look at this list of actions, I do not feel overwhelmed, but rather ambitious to take as many of these twenty actions as I can. These actions are simple, feasible, and do not require a great deal of effort. Moreover, they give you a fair degree of flexibility. For instance, in regards to solution 2: eat for the climate and planet, someone could limit their consumption of red meat, or someone else could become vegan. One of my main takeaways from this course is that it is incredibly important to gauge the relative impact of our actions. For instance, yes we can eat more plant-based, but we have to be conscious of where our produce is coming from.
<br><Hr>
I agree with you very much that Ken's this lecture integrates his previous lessons and lectures. This is a very effective and wonderful lecture. Ken tells us how to save our planet from food, travel, housing, and education. These are the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions (except education). In terms of food, I think food waste is the most effective and easiest problem to solve. Compared to becoming a vegan, it does not require people to change anything. It only requires people to have a sense of not wasting. As the world becomes more international, although I don't think we will reduce the use of airplanes and cars, electric cars are an effective way to help us protect the environment. Therefore, advanced technology has become a top priority. From the perspective of housing, I agree with Ken. All in all, it is reducing the size of the house, and thus reducing carbon emissions. Of course, whether we should move to a more bustling and crowded city instead of going to the suburbs, I think it depends on the individual. I agree with Ken on the idea of more women being educated. This is not only for human rights and gender equality; it also makes the whole family more environmentally conscious. These 20 things are small things in life, but they have a vital impact on environmental protection.
<br><Hr>
I also really liked this video, it gathers all of the solutions we mentioned throughout the quarter. I feel like buying excessive stuff is especially a rising problem recently as the panic of coronavirus become more serious. People started to stock up large amount of foods, water, daily supplies and so on, I saw on the website that a man bought six big bags of rice but later recognize that is too much and returned them to the retailer. But I heard that big-box retailers, usually send their return to be trashed and disposed rather than to be resold. I wonder if this growing buying demand will cause potential problems.

I really enjoyed this lecture video by Ken, because it really shows the plethora of solutions that can be put into action to help decrease the progression of the climate crisis. The first set of 10 were based on personal and cultural changes, which for the most part seemed greatly achievable, in my opinion. Even though these are considered to be individual actions, I find it to be more of a collective action, because if everyone is to participate in these actions collectively all across the world, it will lead to a far greater impact on the progress of climate change. I do always find the second set of solutions, which are political actions, far more important than individual ones, in my opinion, because individual action is like filling up the bucket one droplet at a time, while political action is more like letting the floodgates open, because not only does it bring great change, it brings change quickly. Individual actions, although equally as important, are not as impactful as political actions. Our society and laws are all controlled by our government. They can implement the right decisions that are needed for the betterment of our planet, or it can go the other way around and make the decisions that would lead to the demise of our planet, that’s why it’s up to us to help make that decision by voting for the proper candidates that we believe will help save our planet. 
 <br><br>
The one solution that I found most important was one that was in the political action category and that was number 19, which was joining others. This means that if we want to make an impact on stopping the climate crisis, then we must bind together in the fight for the justice of our planet and for all the living organisms that inhabit it. The only way this could work is if we work together.

<p>
I really enjoyed this video because like Ken said, if we were to show just one of his lectures to a friend, it would be this one. I agree with him because he provides a comprehensive summary of not only what we have learned, but what we should take away from this class. I think it’s important that knowledge itself is not power if it is not followed by action. We have learned tremendously in a few months about the climate crisis, but what we have learned would not mean much if we don’t follow through with action. Though there are way many more, I think if people did on the list that Ken presented, there would be significant change. 
 <br><br>

 Ken first begins with individual action. Though I think collective action is more effective than individual efforts, I still think what Ken lists is important. This is particularly because this list is aimed more towards people in developed countries. I think that individual people in developed countries should really keep an eye on their carbon footprint, especially those who are economically stable or rich since they are able to do so more easily. In addition, most of what Ken lists are caused by people in the first world. For example, many people in poorer countries do not eat nearly as much meat as people in richer countries. In addition, wasting food seems like only something a developed country would do. For example, food in supermarkets are thrown away if past the “due date” or if one product of a bunch is inedible. 
 <br><br>

The distinction that Ken makes between veganism/freganism and climatarianism is very important. People are able to make food choices that take in consideration the environment. For example, Ken states that eating asparagus in the winter uses the same energy as eating chicken or pork, since it is imported from South America, something I never considered. 
 <br><br>

The collective and political actions that Ken states are also very important. For example, speaking to people about issues is very important. Many people want to do the right thing, they are just unaware what is the right thing. For example, I did not know how much of a carbon footprint eating meat takes up, so I have not eaten meat in a while. Ken mentions that it is hard to learn facts because contrarians spend so much money to confuse people on certain issues. Therefore, educating others and yourself is something important that Ken mentioned and would not only help mitigate the climate crisis, but other issues as well.

This video lecture was extremely helpful. It sums up all we've learned, reminding us of what we CAN do. It also presents the perfect video to show my family or friends. Hopefully when they see it, they will become interested in at least one of these points and find the video lecture on the YouTube channel about it. It was cool to see how a lot of the solutions had to do with community and sharing. I've become increasingly interested in communal living and feeling that sense of community, so revisiting all these solutions, and seeing the commonality between most of them being in building strong senses of community. It seems so simple yet we've slowly drifted towards an individualistic culture. I used to think I needed so much space, and dreaded the lack of space I'd have living in dorms. However, I've really enjoyed most aspects of dorm life. The lack of space I was dreading is not an issue. All my friends are like a 2 minute walk from my room and I'm happy. This video and the class in general has really shifted my view on the Climate Crisis. I went form reliance on the next Elon Musk type figure to pop up and popularize carbon capture, or some other technology to save us, to seeing the issue as a cultural one. One that I can have an actual impact on. I saw that happiness doesn't need to be sacrificed to save the planet, and that it's more the opposite that happiness will be a side effect of saving the planet. This video will most definitely be saved and ready to be shared, and the climate crisis will definitely be a talking point art my next family dinner.

I’m commenting in your reply because I particularly liked how you emphasized how the video reminds us of “what we CAN do.” I think it is very easy to go down a pessimistic spiral of how the world is going to sh*t and there are powerful institutions like big oil and agribusiness that make it difficult to feel that you can have some sense of control of this madness. However, this video reminds you of what can be (and should be done). As a result of being in this class for the past 9 or so weeks, I have done the following to help save the planet: 
 <br><br>

1. Waste food less - I really took up the task of meal prepping my food and taking note of how much I actually eat as opposed to how much I serve myself. In addition to this, I make note of things I don't eat as often as I believe I do so I don't repurchase them. I do this to stop me from throwing out food when it gets old.
 <br><br>

2. Eat more plant-based meals - Before I would just “happen” to eat plant based meals. Now, I purposely buy plant-based products in replace of meat options (tofurky italian sausage is 10/10). I still eat meat, however, I eat very little as opposed to before and do so by incorporating more plant based meals. Also, if you want to start eating less meat but don’t like the way tofu tastes, the Tofurky Italian sausage I mentioned earlier tastes amazing and it’s vegan. 
 <br><br>

3. Quit buying things I don’t need and buying things second hand when I do - I used to have a habit of buying things I didn’t need. After taking an evaluation at my lifestyle and bank account, buying new things constantly just isn’t feasible for myself, my bank account, and the world anymore. My mentality used to be “Brand new first, thrift second,” but my view of things has switched (unless they are necessities like underwear, etc.) I am in the process of buying whatever I need second hand first.
 <br><br>

In the future I hope to cut meat products (including dairy, so yes no yummy cheese) out of my diet and eat more plant-based meals with some poultry and fish. However, I understand this process is not overnight and will take extreme dedication to myself and the planet to be successful.


<br><hr>
 I think you put this perfectly. This video is a perfect way to wrap up the course because it summarizes all we’ve learned. But, now that we know all this information, it's our duty as stewards of the environment to pass this information on. Just imagine how much of an impact we could have if each student in this class (800+ students right?) sent this video to 2,5, or 10 of their friends and family. 
 <br><br>


Additionally, I was also most interested in the community oriented goals. Personally, I am a very community- oriented person. I feel the most purpose out of life when I’m involved in a group and I find myself creating a family no matter where I am. So not only do these types of solutions help the planet, but they can catalyze a community into growth. Although I’m not personally fascinated in communal living, I see myself living with roommates for the next chunk of time, and I wouldn’t want it any other way. 
 <br><br>


Overall, I have the same sentiment that you have about this class. This class taught me that cutting back on emissions doesn’t require loss or giving up anything, but can help you form a better life. And that knowledge makes me happy :).
<br><hr>
I agree with you that the communal aspect of many potential solutions makes them seem more attainable. In fact, I discussed a similar satisfaction in terms of communal living in my comment on the film “Happy.” Whether it’s in the dorms, in IV, or even after college, living in close quarters with your friends can not only be fun, its an easy way to pick up positive habits from eachother. In that sense, I think we all have a responsibility to try to extend whichever habits we are able to take on to those around us. Even if each of us can only really practice a few of Ken’s 20 changes at first, if we are able to get our families and friends to do the same, it will have a much more significant impact. Like you, I used to expect that some revolutionary technology would appear to save us and, while I’m still holding out hope, I’ve also started to come to terms with the fact that we all need to make changes where we can regardless. On a final note, this video is definitely the most shareable of the whole bunch!

This lecture video was very helpful as a summary of environmental problems and solutions this class has so far addressed. These positive videos have always been my favorite in the lecture series as the climate crisis is a very heavy subject and knowing that there are still options available to curve the effects of carbon emissions helps put my mind at ease. As Ken referred to in his first list, a move towards a plant-based diet is really the biggest impact the world could have on the environment, if implemented world-wide. I still find this goal to be a little unreachable due to the mindset of many Americans, but the second biggest solution is to educate women on an equal level as men. This seems like a very reasonable request and something that, honestly, should have been introduced long ago. 

 <br><br>

On Ken’s second list, he addresses the importance of collective action. He stresses that another very important place to take action is at the polls. Voting is extremely important for the environment because we have the power to elect officials that can advocate for the climate crisis. Additionally, we are able to use this power to pass new laws, such as carbon taxes or (hopefully) the Green New Deal, that will have a direct effect on the amount of carbon emissions produced and released into the atmosphere. Due to the importance of this step, I put a lot more thought into my voting this year than in the previous one. I decided to back candidates that represent my views on the environment and actively are pursuing methods to alleviate the stress we have put on this world. I believe that by doing this, I am truly contributing towards the collective action to address the climate crisis.

I enjoyed this recap of the course. It was cool to see how I did gain a substantial amount of knowledge within these past 9 weeks, and how much my mindset was changed. I became aware of how much travel, food consumption/waste, and fast fashion plays a large role in the climate crisis. I did stop eating beef and have been cutting down on meat consumption because of what I’ve learned, and have been slightly altering the lives of my family and close friends. I also voted for the first time, and actually had the want to vote. Before this course, I didn’t plan on voting because I felt like I wasn’t educated enough on today’s politics. Now, I see that voting is arguably one of the most impactful actions a human can take. Like Ken stated, we should vote for the right people who advocate the right things, who really care about the climate crisis and the people as a whole. I agree that this would be a giant leap towards attaining both a greener and happier world.
 <br><br>

The first ten solutions were changes that pertained to cultural and personal change, which Ken stated. The fact that these were not technological solutions shows how anyone can implement these lifestyle changes. This makes solutions to the climate crisis very inclusive and collaborative. In regards to the last ten solutions, I strongly agree with each and every one of them. I think it is very important to have effective communication. Like any relationship with any person in your life, communication is one of the biggest aspects of a healthy, friendly bond between people, and can ultimately impact others. Relating this to the climate crisis, through having prior knowledge, communicating this crisis can be very effective, especially if counter arguments are addressed. It’s all about gaining information, communicating it effectively, and implementing these ideas into your daily life. I’ve learned that climate change consists of several topics that I never thought would fall into this category, and I’m very happy that I am now aware of several lifestyle changes I can implement.

I totally agree. I love being able to look back on what I knew at the start of the quarter as compared to now. This was one of the first classes I've taken where I've felt like I'm getting truly educated, not just studying for a test and a requirement. In fact, I found myself, when taking notes, writing down the things that I found personally interesting or applicable rather than things that might appear on the test. Being able to almost relive the last 9 weeks through this one video made me really appreciative of how much I've learned this quarter.
 <br><br>
I think that all of these suggestions are very important as well. However, one that really stood out to me was number 17, rethinking. We have to be constantly looking at ourselves and our culture, assessing and reassessing, and always seeking to better. We cannot afford to get caught on stagnant ideas that will result in our destruction, we must keep rethinking how we respond to all the problems we're presented with. The way your views on voting changed over the quarter is a great example of this in practice; there are always more things for us to learn and rethink to help our climate!



</span></div><hr>

<p>
In this video, Ken summarized the content of this course by listing ten personal actions and ten collective actions we learned throughout this course. He not only stressed the main points we talked about in class but also encouraged us to make changes, no matter the action is personal or collective. I am grateful since I took this course, which allows me to gain more knowledge about climate change, such as the reasons behind climate crisis, the solutions to global warming, and the actions we need to take in our daily lives. I think it is important for us to remember what Ken had taught in his lectures because climate change is a big issue, which closely related to the earth and its future. Through this course, we know the emergency of this issue, and we need to take action to change the situation immediately.




</p><hr>


<p>
This list of 10 things you can do personally and 10 things you can do collectively with others at a greater level shows the fact that personal action is just as important as collective action. We must not fail to consider one because we are focused on the other. Initially, at a few weeks into the course, I was still a bit confused as to why Ken was not focusing on things that we can do to help. However, the second half of the course provided so much insight and answered all the questions that I had. 
 <br><br>
After this course is over, I plan on printing this list and putting it on my wall. I will look at it from time to time and ask myself if I am actively doing these things. In addition, I will continue to change my diet and lifestyle according to what I learned.
 <br><br>
I would like to say that I believe number twenty: embody change. I believe that if you change, others will follow. If everyone is thinking “I won’t change because someone else will”, everything will remain stagnant.

Like many others have stated, this is the perfect recap summarization of this entire quarter in this course with ENGL 23 in one lecture video. It covers all the main pieces of focus and the key takeaways that we should embed within each and every one of us as we proceed to approach the future. Additionally, this is probably the best video, and most popular video that many of us are sending out to our friends and families in hopes of spreading your words and the hopes of many of us throughout our society in this manner. The best part of this video like a previous video you have done in a list like format where we are provided all our many diverse options on how we can get started today. Another thought that occurred to me is that this is an opening that shows us how it is not only one way that opens us to the saving of our planet, rather only with the combination of efforts in multiple different areas of method can we bring about the change we need. Between individual and collective actions, there is so much to be done and so much on our checklist to cover, but each being a crucial part of it all. So many of us have noticed subtle, unconscious changes amongst our everyday actions which is incredible on its own, however, a great feat if I must say so for myself, considering that change is known to not be simple. Spreading these educated ideas for people to learn about the choices they are making with the full hand of options before them gives them the conscience and insurance they might need. Our comment sections are filled with many like minded individuals as well as those that seek to make differences for all. I hope that our comments might reach the many out there looking for a movement of people for encouragement in taking these steps, not alone!

What this video really emphasizes for me is that being an environmentalist is a full lifestyle, not just a set of beliefs or ideas. Being an environmentalist requires one to dedicate themselves to constant improvement, both of themselves and of the social, political, and economic systems they partake in. Overall, this class has made me much more aware of how my lifestyle and political beliefs are linked to environmental justice. A year ago, when asked during an interview for an internship what my top 3 political issues I cared about were, I said reproductive justice, environmentalism, and gun control. I now realize that reproductive justice and environmentalism are deeply intertwined, and I can be both a feminist and an environmentalist, and use those things to build off of each other instead of considering them separate things. Other political issues I care about, like urban planning and public transportation, also have a massive and direct impact on my carbon footprint.
 <br><br>
Ultimately, I still feel (as I have insisted in many comments throughout the course) that the personal is political. I do not believe we needed two separate lists of ways to combat climate change. Government decisions on all levels impact individuals and communities daily lives deeply, and people in turn (should, in a proper democracy) impact their government. I think that politics should become part of people's lifestyles, since policy certainly is. Policies regarding public transportation, schooling, marriage, taxes, and numerous other issues, all impact us on a daily basis. Therefore, I do not consider political activism separate from my lifestyle changes as I try to be a better environmentalist and live a greener lifestyle; to me, they are one in the same. However, the content of both these lists is very accurate, motivating, and should spur us all to begin to implement changes in ourselves and the world around us, regardless of how we choose to categorize these changes. While some people may consider some personal, and some political, I consider every item on both lists a decision that is both personal and political. For example,  eating plant-based seems like a personal decision, but it is boycotting meat industries and impacting the economy, and in turn, our government's actions to regulate that economy.

I believe that this lecture video provides a great recap of what we have learned so far in this class. I really like how this large list actually comprises two smaller lists: the first focusing on individual actions and second focusing on the political and collective actions. I am the type of person who is very forgetful and gets overwhelmed with large amounts of information. Therefore, I feel like this is a nice video that I can use to reference when needed instead of watching all of the lecture videos all over again. For me, I need to work on my buying habits, especially regarding number eight and ten on the list. Before taking this class, I would buy items that I did not actually need and they were definitely not from companies that are considered to be environmentally friendly. However, I have now become more conscious about what I was buying and where I am buying those items from. In addition, I also want to contribute to saving the planet by protesting, which is number fifteen on the list. I have never been in a strike to protest regarding the climate crisis before, mainly because I do not like crowds all that much. However, I do want to try something out of my comfort zone. Therefore, if I did attend a strike, then I would try something new out of my comfort zone and contribute to saving the planet. A win-win situation. However, I am happy to say that I do practice number five and six on the list. Because of the way Isla Vista/Goleta/Santa Barbara is set up, it is more convenient to walk, bike, and use public transportation. Therefore, I chose not to bring up a car as 25% of our climate footprint come from owning a car from the average American. In addition, I also live with five other people in my apartment in Isla Vista, choosing to co-house instead of living by myself, even though I rather live by myself because I value my personal time.

After viewing this lecture video, I was really touched by Ken's examples of telling us to save the environment. As a normal citizen, what we can do about the climate crisis is really not much. We can't start a new policy or let the factories to stop working, that would literally influence the economy of a country, it would hurt the benefit of some big Corporations.But what we can do can also protect our environment, once more and more people start to accomplish and it can snowball the effect. Ken gives us a lot of good advice. We can drive less cars and ride more public transportations, use less plastic things. Because currently, we still didn't find any methods to decompose the plastic without carrying out pollutions. Once we buried the plastic under the soil, it can take hundreds and thousands of years for the plastic to be decomposed. And the soil definitely would be polluted by the plastic.

I completely agree. At times it can definitely feel discouraging when we feel like we are the only people that care about certain issues such as the climate crisis, and that what we are doing is not making a difference at all. However, this video helps to remind us that what we are doing does make a difference and what we are doing does matter. We must continue to fight and do whatever we can in order to fight this issue, because that is what will lead to real change. If we are not the ones to fight for our planet, then who will?

This list of 20 things that each one of us can do in order to help the planet and help the climate crisis is very doable. The first 10 very does are things that you could do a person/ daily basis. Having a list of effective things that every one of us can do is very helpful. I really like the idea of being a climatarian. I have always limited the meat I would eat already so being a cilmatarian just lets me eat while knowing that the way I am eating is return helping the planet. Knowing that I can make a difference by changing the way I eat is rewarding in the end. This would also help in terms of being more conscious of what you are eating and how it is affecting the planet. Birth control is something that is also something that people should know about. Being educated on birth control can really help with the climate crisis. High schools and middle schools should have this type of education for their students. If there is a way to educated people on birth control is through that time in their education. Using more public transportation is something that I can do more of and will do more of. Choosing and being more conscious of what I buy and how I live is something that I would like to expand on. Making sure that what I buy adds some type of value in my life is a thing that I need to get better at. Thrifting and buying things from fairtrade places is something that I want to do. On a bigger scale voting and being politically active in terms of fighting for the green new deal and laws that will help climate change. Being active in the community is something that will always be rewarding and something that I will continue to do. Doing everything in my power to help the planet and help fight the climate crisis is always going to be rewarding and will make me happy.

As I watched this video I thought, “Wow, this is going to be a great resource for when I review for the final,” but above my reasons finding this lecture useful, I saw it as the ultimate 24 minutes of this lecture series and the link I share with all my family and friends to begin their journeys for playing their part in saving the planet.  I appreciated the solutions presented in the video that not only had environmental gains, but benefits for uplifting underprivileged demographics.  For example, I greatly enjoyed seeing the education of women being emphasized in this video, seeing as I am a woman myself seeking an education to better the world in my own way.  It’s not say the education of women is solely to educate them about climate change and what they can do about it, but it’s so they can take control of their reproductive rights, choose a future that benefit their families when/if they choose to start one.

I completely agree with you. I feel like this lecture video was particularly helpful and I will definitely be sending this to family and friends so that I can spread this knowledge. I also really appreciate when Ken presents us with different solutions like he does in this lecture. It can be kind of discouraging to watch all of the films in this class because I feel like most of them tend to leave the audience feeling completely helpless. However, videos like this one remind us that there are so many ways that we can help with the climate crisis and little things that we can change about our lifestyles. I also appreciated that Ken brought up the education of women and related it to this class, because there are countless social justice issues that relate to the climate crisis, and it is very important to recognize that.


<br><hr>
I also believe that this video is going to be a great resource to share with others.  The climate crisis seems almost too big to manage, but Ken offers us a relatively complete list actions we can take to make the world a safer and better place. I have actually shared this resource with a teach at my old high school   who really makes an effort to reduce his carbon footprint by living in a city, biking everywhere, eating vegetarian, and not using plastic. He is going to use this resource for a class he is going to teach next semester so I will recommend him this video as it is a good summary of everything we have learned in the class.  I think it is also important to recognize how most of these actions are easy.  While some, such as living in a city, are not always up to our control, others such as voting are.  Having a simple, actionable list really makes it easy to decide what we are going to do and how to do it if we want to make the world a better place.

This video was an excellent recap of the entire course. I am glad that Ken decided to make this video because I would not have remembered everything that we have talked about. If anyone needs to know how to combat the climate crisis, this is the perfect video to watch. He gives a general description of what needs to be done while it also discusses examples and alternatives to putting these practices in place. Each of these actions should be incorporated into everyone's daily lives. 
 <br><br>
I also enjoyed this video due to the fact that it gives me hope for saving the planet. When you think about everything on this list that can be done to combat climate change, it does not seem that bad. It seems completely feasible. There are so many little things that would not impact your life in a huge way and is easy to implement on a normal basis. I would definitely recommend this video to anyone who is trying to learn a little bit more on the role that they can play in regard to the climate crisis. 
 <br><br>
Watching this video reminded me of how much I enjoyed this class. We have learned so much about the climate crisis. It has shown me how much I can actually do to save the planet, and it has also helped me communicate to others about the problem at hand. It has made me question things about my lifestyle that I did not even know mattered. I hope that everyone will consider putting all of the things into practice from here on out.

I think that this is a good way to start wrapping up this class. I’m glad that Ken listed out his top 20 best things to reduce emissions. I find it interesting though that he goes back and forth between individual things we can do as people and larger things we can do as a country. Again I want to use traveling by air as an example. 80% of all flights are done by 1% of people. It's interesting that people might not be able to see it, but anyone, no matter how rich, can be a part of this 1%. It’s weird to see how these people can emit so many CO2 emissions without even realizing that they’re not even the majority of people. Ken also dives into political issues. I think that the climate crisis should be an issue that both sides of the political aisle confront. While I think that there are a range of other issues that need to be confronted through politics, the climate crisis should be towards the top of the list. While personal activism is important, the biggest things we can do to confront the climate crisis is through voting and spreading awareness. This would have more impact than any diet change one person can make. I’m glad Ken shared his ideas with us, and many of these I have already heard and it makes them that much more relevant to me.

This video was very effective in summarizing the important points that were established throughout the duration of this quarter.  It does a good job of outlining the major humankind actions that are cause climate change and providing well thought-out solution for trying to mitigate it moving forward. One of the key points that Ken hits is making sure to communicate climate change issues with those who are less informed of it - this video can actually be used as a tool of communication to quickly and effectively teach someone. 

 <br><br>

 When entering this class, one of the most important things I wanted to find out by the end of the quarter was a list of concrete actions individuals could take on the daily basis. After going through the course materials and after watching this video, I find that there are 3 major action individuals can take to help curb their personal climate impact. 1) Living a simpler life - cutting down on things you don't NEED and maximizing what you have. Example: smaller house, urbanization, etc 2) Moving to more efficient forms of transportation. Example: public transit over personal cars, less air travel 3) Voting to reduce harmful activities such as fracking

This video really did feel like the capstone of this course, and with this I know that this class will be coming to an end soon. I at first took this course because I needed to reach the minimum number of units, and why not participate in a course that had relevance to my major? I don’t regret this decision at all, because this class has taught me so much more about the climate crisis than I ever knew - from the readings, to the videos, to the comments from classmates. From all the media we’ve consumed in this class, it’s clear to see that there are many different ways to approach the topic of climate change (ex: cultural, social, political, technological, etc). Going down the two lists of ways we can still save the planet reaffirmed everything I’ve learned from this class so far, and it made me feel optimistic for how all of us will move forward while keeping these points in mind.

Yeah, this class has helped me to think critically about the issue of climate change. Prior to this class I believed in climate change, similar to ho I believed that the earth is not flat, but I had no conviction about doing anything about it. I did not realize that this is my issue and my generations issue as I just thought that some scientist somewhere was coming up with some ingenious technological solution. It think it is a shame that I had to go through to college pay many grands to learn this information when this should have been taught to us in middle school and high school. Alas major corporations have turned this into a political issue when at its heart it is a scientific one. Sure the action we take must include political action but we cannot deny the science of the climate crisis. The politics should be on the specific actions we take to combat this problem not on whether there is a massive conspiracy and all the scientists are lying to us. Climate change and its implications should be common knowledge for our generation and even generations prior but sadly the American education system has failed us in that respect. If the American education system had not failed us then it would likely be so much easier to drive people to make changes to combat climate change.

This lecture provides a great, concise summary of the top 20 things that we can do to help save the planet. I appreciate how Ken grouped the list into collective actions and individual actions, allowing us to first think about what we can change individually, and then what we can do by working together. Relating to this week’s film “Happy”, there are two intrinsic goals that are, apparently, the true sources of long-lasting happiness: personal growth and community feeling. Every single solution discussed in this video hits at least one of these two “happiness sources”, further supporting my thought that climate-conserving solutions don’t actually entail “giving up” anything, but can in fact benefit both the environment as well as our own health. If all of these solutions seem too difficult for you, then I feel as though you really don’t care about the environment, the future of our planet, or the lives of millions of people. Not applying any of these solutions to your own life also withholds you from experiencing personal growth and from contributing positively to your community, so you will likely achieve nothing positive anyway. 
  <br><br>

Plus, actively engaging in activities that are well-known to be harmful and damaging to our world may lead to cognitive dissonance, which will simply decelerate your road to true happiness. Essentially, what I am trying to say is that there is no positive outcome if you choose to continue living your life carelessly and selfishly, but there are endless positive outcomes if you choose to start contributing positively toward the fight against climate change. 
 <br><br>
 
I feel as though it is so clear to see that working as a community would be far more beneficial to not only this crisis, but to the general wellness of the community as a whole. Working together to fill in someone’s “weak spots” with your strengths would mean easier, more efficient working methods. Working together to enact change would bring about greater recognition, which in turn could lead to even greater amounts of change. Working together to agree upon rules and policies and making compromises would result in more fairness for all. Yet, there are so many groups who are actively hurting other people for their own benefit (big corporations being the one of these groups), all because we have created this societal view that more money=more power=better life=happier life. If we could achieve a true societal paradigm shift, we could maybe, just maybe, finally reach equality, at least on some scales. Far-fetched, I know, but a girl can dream.

I feel thankful for videos like this. It not only gives me hope but also gives me realistic solutions and a way to make a change. There are so many skeptics right now that always demand "facts" and ways to battle this crisis, but now I just have to show them this video. If they are in so much denial that this simple video doesn't tempt them, there is no hope for them. That is the problem with our current society, they no longer want to listen to the other side, they are so determined that they are right, that anything we say is automatically impossible and straight up junk. They call us alarmists but being in blindsight denial seems far worst for me.

This is definitely the video I would recommend to a friend or family member summing up what I learned from this class and what we can do to help save the planet and solve the climate crisis! All of the suggestions that the list gives are great things we can all do in the developed world not only to mitigate the climate crisis but to live lives that have us come together as a human race, set aside the differences we find in each other, and live more peaceful lives. One of the main takeaways for me from this course is how I've rethought and gained a new perspective on the capitalist system which we live under. Often touted by many as one of the greatest achievements of humanity and a really great thing, this course has really helped to show me how driven by greed this system has become and how unsustainable it has become. Ultimately, I have seen how overworking for material goods does not equal happiness. I would much rather have a lot more free time in my day to spend doing activities I please like spending time with loved ones than live with the stress of an overbearing job to buy a big house and flashy car that in turn destroy the planet. I am so thankful for Ken and this class and that I will now use this knowledge to become the change I want to see in the world!

Me too. This video is worth sharing and spreading to the world. No one living in this century should be unaware of the solutions we can carry out. I am also grateful to have this opportunity to watch this video, conveying the importance to start making changes by yourself. In terms of happiness, you gain happiness and kindness from bringing positive and useful influences to our world. Not only people who are poor should be sacrificing themselves for reducing their carbon emissions but also it is, in fact, those who are wealthy have to reflect on themselves on their living habits and lifestyles.

I think this video was an excellent conclusion to the course. Ken did a great job identifying and summarizing the fundamental elements of the course. The list outlines steps people in the developed countries can possibly ease the damage that has already been done. It is therefore important for us, the younger generation, to take the information we have learned and translate it into action. Unlike many other courses that we will take, the things we’ve learned throughout Climate Crisis 101 calls on us to take personal and relevant action. In the present context, I believe the most impactful way we can translate our knowledge into positive change is to vote. 
 <br><br>
With the right people in power and enough supporters behind them, I have no doubt that impactful changes could be made if everyone who cared voted. While personal action and changes can make a significant impact, we can’t missight of opportunities that allow for greater collective action. This election season is one of those opportunities where enough votes could radically change the country's stance on climate issues. The ability to make our voices heard should not be wasted.

The lecture video for this week is a really nice and neat summary of 20 things that each of us can try to incorporate into our daily lives in the goal of saving our environment and ourselves. It was a wonderfully educational video that I can send to my family, friends, and others around me who are interested in taking personal actions to mitigate the climate crisis. I think this video did a really good at raising awareness of the environmental issues that we face currently while projecting a sense of optimism into the grim nature of the climate crisis that if we start acting right now and taking those 20 personal actions into our own lives, then hopefully climate change will come to a halt as it is still not too late to make changes to the ways we live and inhabit this planet yet. The information presented in this video seems to be a great beginning to the progress of mitigating the climate crisis because of each of the 20 things listed is so easy and simple to accomplish in our lives without causing major disruptions or shifts in our lives, and we can all do those 20 things easily to benefit our environment and also to make our lives more meaningful by contributing to the overall positive cause of protecting our planet and alleviating climate change. Just like a couple of other comments have mentioned, I was also somewhat surprised to see how prevalent voting is in the list that active political participation can play a significant role in reducing carbon emission and saving our environment as environmentally-conscious politicians will advocate for laws and policies aimed to address climate change such as regulations on the limits of carbon emission allowed for fossil fuel companies and nationwide utilization of reusable power sources in both public facilities and private homes. 
 <br><br>


Looking back on the lectures and all the information I have learned regarding our planet and the issue of climate change so far in this class, I have gained new knowledge regarding our environment which I used to think I know so well simply because I have lived with it for my entire life. I also feel that I have carried on a new sense of responsibility in terms of advocating and implementing changes to make a difference in our society’s approach to our environment and the use of natural resources in the environment. Being a member of the young, ambitious, and hopeful Generation Z, we are the hope for the world and for climate change essentially as we understand more of the pressing nature and the urgency of the climate crisis and its disastrous consequences on humanity and all other lives on the planet if this issue is continuously being ignored. We are more open to taking measures to address this issue and more optimistic towards our future when appropriate actions are taken to solve this issue. Therefore, the future lies within our hands and let us start changing the world by doing those 20 things Ken discussed in the lecture video. We will be the changes we want to see in the world.

This video is one of the best I have seen of Ken. I love how concise and straightforward this video was. In comparison to the other videos, it does seem redundant but I think it is important to state the things we can do to lower carbon emission again in case we forgot an action. After watching this video, I realized there is so much more that an individual can do in order to reduce carbon emission and if everyone does it, it does actually make a change. People’s mentality about how “one person’s effort doesn’t really do much so there’s no point in doing it” has to change because it does really make a difference if you look at the bigger picture with everyone doing the same things to reduce carbon emission. 

 <br><br>

Knowing that there are so many steps that I can take in order to reduce my carbon emission makes me happy that I am not limited to one option. Of course, I know I should do everything to reduce my carbon emission, but sometimes there are factors that cause me to release carbon emission even if I don’t want to. Ken also incorporated things we can do as a group such as electing officials that actually know that climate change is real and wants to take action and transferring the information to your acquaintances so they also understand climate change better.  Through this class, I became more conscious of my actions and how it can affect everyone else on this planet and I am very thankful that I learned that.

I too greatly appreciated this video from Ken and it also helped me study for the final as a lot of this information is from many weeks of lectures and readings. I used to think that none of my actions could make a difference, but for the past year, I've been doing more and more to lower my own carbon foot print and that became easier when I stopped worrying about what other people were doing and to just take responsibility for my own actions. I agree that thinking one person can change the world seems naive and makes it hard to start any changes, but from personal experience, I'm glad I stopped eating meat, shopping fast fashion, and finally voted this year- looking back, there is no way I can deny that I helped lower co2 emissions this past year and that going forward, I am excited to spread the message! I think it's important that we not be so hard on ourselves that we say "what's the point of not eating meat if I'm driving a car." I think this attitude is so common, even for me, but I think every effort we put in should be a pat on our back and not a way to think about everything we're not doing. I think even just taking this class and listening to what Ken has to say is a huge and admirable first step!

I think Ken did a great job of compiling everything we've learned in a succinct manner, enough for us to remember these 20 things as we make choices in the future (though I did think a few things were repeated a lot in the video and it might be better to limit them mentioning them once to lower the # of things we need to do). In high school, I used to be very upbeat about climate change thinking that if I recycled and make small changes, I would be doing my part. After taking this class, I truly realized that this climate complexity would be best fought with not just small actions but mindset and lifestyle changes. I think if we each adopted a few of these things and committed to them with the best of our ability, we would not only be healthier and living for future generations, but truly be happier. The more I think about it, the more excited I am about co housing as I start my own future outside of college. I wish my friends and family were able to experience and learn all the information I was through this whole quarter's material. It's just so hard to get them to WANT to talk about things that can be demoralizing and depressing. I want to see if I could potentially get a few of my friends to watch some of the documentaries we have this quarter and then show them this recap video to truly show not just HOW to make changes but WHY it's important to do so. Thank for making this, Ken.
<br><hr>
 Yes, I am so grateful that Ken made this video that summarizes his main concepts for this course. During the first midterm, I have a difficult time because I wasn’t sure what to study since there wasn’t a set study guide or outline. This video definitely makes studying for finals more straightforward since all the concepts are in this short and concise video. I personally think I have to do a little more research after this video just to refresh my memories because we did learn a lot of different concepts from this class. I’m glad that you’re excited to educate others! I also am too because I used to not know a lot regarding carbon emission so whenever people about it, I tend to not say anything in case I don’t have the correct facts but now, I can bring up some concepts with Ken to back me up! I think this information is the basic information that everyone should know about climate change before anyone tries to say “climate change is a hoax”. If they do say that, I’ll just reply with “take English 23”.

I really appreciate Ken for making this video as a wrap-up of the discussions for this entire quarter and also a recap for the materials we covered in class. As Ken said in the lecture, if we can only recommend one video to our friends and family, this would be it. The fact that the twenty things are separated into two lists, one with individual actions and the other being collective and political actions is interesting to me because after I watched through the video, I realized that the solutions on the second list are not all further steps made based on those from the first list, but instead the pre-actions people should make before even going into the first list. 

 <br><br>

There are three entries I see that should be taken on before even making personal actions. The first is "read and educate yourself about climate crisis and the actions you should make”, which is what we are doing now by taking this class. We read, watch, and write about climate crisis, but I believe many of the class hadn’t or still haven’t started to take actions and it’s normal. The first step of learning about it itself is a progress and will be the foundation and “prerequisites” of our future personal actions. The second one is "think about why making actions is so important in order to maintain or revitalize your passion for the cause”. This, I think, is very important as it is always true that you need to find value in the things you plan to keep doing for awhile. Just like the movie from last week mentioned, the three steps of acting upon climate crisis are “head”, “hand”, and “heart”. “Heart” is what we’re discussing right here, and if we don’t see these actions’ true meaning and don’t implement them as our belief and culture, it is hard to persevere. The last one is “become the change you want to see in the world”, which is definitely crucial because we all need to feel confident and assured that our actions are actually paying efforts and have bold faith in ourselves and the future.

The list of actions Ken laid out in this video are presented in a way such that they are achievable and within reach, leaving really no excuse to not make at least one environmental change in your life. I do like the points that you have presented, especially the three personal actions that should be fully achieved before anything else. I really do believe that all of the climate change mitigation can efficiently proceed with self evaluation and personal change. Building a strong foundation on the smaller scale will allow for great results produced from the actions taken on a larger scale. We must approach this looming issue with as much love and energy as this planet gives back to us. We must look at ourselves and see what we have imposed upon our home and seek to destroy and amend anything possible to alleviate it of the accumulation. This class has spoken to me and what I should do and in sharing the material covered in the course, I would hope to show other people what they can do for the planet and for themselves.

This week’s lecture video was a great conclusion to the course, and Ken did a great job summarizing the main topics of the course into one video. Ken listed ten individual actions as well as ten collective and political actions. The individual actions addressed many topics such as reducing food waste, eating a more plant based diet, public transportation, and taking on a more minimalist approach to a daily lifestyle. The more collective actions such as voting, collaboration, and activism, and making changes through the government. It is so important for the younger generations to vote because in order to see change, we need to vote for those who are going to take charge in the fight against climate change. After this class, I can definitely say that I have already taken steps to reduce my own emissions; I have adapted a more plant based diet, voted for the politicians who I thought would make the most change environmentally, and hope to one day become a very minimalist person and reduce my consumption. This video did such a great job summarizing the past ten weeks and I think that it is a great video to share with others so they can acquire more knowledge about the climate crisis and the ways they can make changes to their everyday lives in order to make a change.

that this was a great way for Ken to conclude this course. Overall, I think Ken’s main goal was that each student who takes this class will understand the urgency of the climate crisis, implement things, like the aspects on this list, in their daily routine to stop climate change, and teach friends and family about doing the same. Before taking this course, there are probably 5-7 things on Ken’s list that I had done in my daily life, including being conscious with my food choices (I do not eat red meat), using contraception, biking to school rather than driving, and repairing/trading instead of renting, to name a few. Similarly to Emily, after taking this course, I have learned about the importance of doing so much more, and have learned how easy it is to implement some of these things in my life. For example, I always knew it was important to vote, but was never old enough to do so. Now that I have the power to voice my opinions, I will do so by voting in each election. Also, throughout this course I have read and educated myself on steps I can take, and am now able to share this knowledge with friends and family. I appreciate Ken for encouraging us all to be the change that we want to see in this world, and am glad that I had the opportunity to take this course this quarter.

<p>
This video especially had some strong points that Ken makes that truly resonate with me. Looking at this list of 20 items, I realize that I could be doing so much more to help the earth and that not everything that you do has to be so difficult. An example of this is limiting our food waste and trying to switch to a more plant based diet. Not only is this something that can be easily achieved, it is also beneficial for both the planet and our physical welfare. Something that is also very important is our practice of minimalism. By buying only things we need, it eliminates the problem of having too many things and manufacturers overproducing and being unable to sell. For consumers, this is extremely beneficial due to the fact that we don’t need to overspend and overbuy because of our greed. Something optimal would be buying things that are necessary to survive and limit things that we don’t really need in order to maintain a balance so that we have mostly things that we actually need. Voting is also an important point to make because of the country we live in. By voting we are able to put into office those who align with our beliefs including the belief that we need to reduce our carbon emissions and make drastic changes in order to save the earth. We need to spread the knowledge that voting is a crucial thing that we can do in order to prevent our planet from spiraling out of control and before we do something that we can’t reverse. We are slowly heading into decline and we need to stop the decline before there’s nothing we can do and by voting for those who will fight for what we believe in, we are able to change world one step at a time.

This video did really a good job on summarizing what we can do about the climate crisis in terms of individual and collective actions. So far, by joining this class, this community, I feel that I've learned so much. I now have a brand perspective to look at the world, to think about my relationship with stuff. I was stunned about the impacts of humans on the planet and other living things, all the injustice, and how poor people in the developed countries and innocent animals suffering, losing their homes. I was sad to see gradually, the earth would soon become inhabitable, and all humans will suffer because of what we did. But with those solutions, those actable solutions, I start to rebuild my confidence in the future and image a sustainable planet where all beings are living peacefully, fairly, and happily. I want to point out the list of 20 things is so instrumental because we can act on the list starting from now. We don't have to rely on technology that takes time to be developed. Earlier in this quarter, I asked a question: what can an everyday person like me do about it? I am glad that now I have enough knowledge to answer this question. More importantly, I am taking action. When I am at the dining halls, I carefully choose plates and make sure I eat them all and don't waste any food. I take a moment before buying anything and pay attention to its manufacturing process or ingredients...There are definitely more actions to take, and making changes is not easy. But I don't want to be ignorant anymore. And I don't want anyone in the class to be ignorant either with the knowledge at hand.

<p>
I’m grateful for how this video sums up everything we learned over the course of this class.


 <br><br>


My biggest takeaway was what Ken said about careers and the climate crisis. I think it’s really inspirational on how he said that it doesn't matter specifically what career path one goes through, any career position can play its role in protecting the environment and reducing carbon emissions. It’s not just policy makers who have a chance at making an impact, but chefs, city planners, filmmakers, writers, and comedians. We can choose to follow our passion while keeping it in our minds that what we choose to do in our everyday lives, not just personal or as a collective, but in our careers as well, can make a huge difference for our planet. With that in mind, I understand just the extent of how important education is. Taking this course has opened my eyes to how my actions directly or indirectly affect the planet. I will keep this information with me for the rest of my life, and I will make choices in the future, such as thrifting more or choosing sustainable transportation and housing, based on this knowledge. If every single person, especially young people, in the world was able to have this information to understand the correlation of human action and the climate change, the “future” that Ken talks about could happen a lot sooner. More people will be at the polls, voting for candidates who want to implement changes, there would be more pressure to stop fracking and other unsustainable practices in search of a transition to more green sources of energy, and there would be more pressure for developed countries like the US to produce less meat and go off a more plant based diet. All in all, we can all make a difference, but it’s important to have that knowledge first.

What you said about keeping this information with me for the rest of my life really resonated with me as well. While I'm by no means an expert in the climate crisis, the way I see things has changed due to this course. The next time I'm on an airplane, or the next time I'm voting for a member of office, I'll definitely think back to what I learned in this class. Just the knowledge that any purchase I make has an environmental impact will make me rethink what choices I make and how I live my life. I'm privileged that I've been educated on these topics while the majority of people are not as lucky. This course has really opened my mind to the things in the world that really matter, and how my individual actions can make a difference. 
 <br><br>
I still think the most impactful and important action we can do to fight the climate crisis is voting for people who will put the earth first. It's obvious that eating less meat and driving less will reduce carbon emissions, but voting takes significantly fewer time and is much easier to do than anything else on the list. Anyone can vote, and I believe if we get more people, especially youth, to vote, a huge difference can be made. 
 <br><br>
After this video, I am pretty optimistic about our future. Compared to the first week with Wells' "The uninhabitable earth", I firmly believe that the climate crisis will be resolved in our lifetime. With the upcoming presidential and a shift to a more activist and environmentally aware n society, our Earth is gradually being saved.


<br><hr>
I definitely enjoyed Ken's description of how anyone in any career can make an impact on the climate. You don't have to be an environmental scientist or a climatologist. On the same note, one thing that I took away from the course that I will keep for the rest of my life is the idea of minimalism. This idea of minimalism takes up multiple different sections in this video such as having smaller houses or buying less clothes. After reading Thoreau and watching the movie "Happy", I have been given a great sense of comfort in the idea that I don't need to have a job that pays hundreds of thousands of dollars or have a huge house. I believe that I will be happier in my future now with a house where I can just have my basic needs. Even if I do end up getting a job where I have a high pay, I don't need to buy multiple cars, I could invest that into getting solar panels for my house or buying an electric car, etc.  You talk about how if everyone had all the information listed above, the "future" that Ken talks about could happen sooner. I believe this idea of simplism is the most important to get into the heads of the younger generations. We will be happier if we ditch this consumerism mindset. 
 <br><br>
On another note, you also mention education as one of the most important factors to helping our planet. I completely agree. Education of the younger generation by not only educating in school but also by teaching personal action will be the difference between a green-focused new generation and extinction. Proper education on this topic will also lead to voting for candidates that will implement great change in the country. This course has made it climate change a higher priority on my list when voting for candidates and along with simplism, spreading awareness of climate change will be necessary if we want our younger generations to vote and keep our world green.

I found this video extremely helpful as it is concluding all the main things we have been talking about in class and list out the important things (individually and collectively / politically) that we can do from now on to help save our planet. There is something we have already covered in class before so it kind of refreshes my mind when I read it again but I still find it very good to read it one more time. 
 <br><br>

        As we all know election day is coming so I think it is a good time that we all who can vote to give a vote to the person that can help make change through policies.Also there are a few other things that I think i will also start doing, such as eating less beef and only buy enough stuff/food to avoid creating waste. Also, as inspired by Kalmus, I will also start taking bikes and public transportation instead of using my own car. But some of the methods mentioned in the video are harder for me and my family to do, eg moving to co-housing,etc. But I think we can do it to start saving energy and using less electricity if possible.
     <br><br>
 
        I want to say this class is amazing and I truly enjoy this class. I learnt a lot about global warming in just these few weeks and changed the way I think a lot. I also start recognizing my responsibility as someone living on this planet to really be part of tackling the issue and making changes in this  moment and provide a sustainable place to live for our future generation.

I also found this video extremely helpful as it concluded and basically summed up the course in one video. Just by watching this video there is something that anyone can do to reduce their carbon footprint and CO2 emissions. After watching this video there are things that I can do myself to help fight against climate change. For example something that everyone can do is spread knowledge spread your awareness of climate change with your friends, family, etc. which is something I plan to do when I go back home from spring break. Buying less stuff this includes shoes, clothes and simply things that I do not need in my day to day life. Fast fashion is something that affect he climate tremendously and people who live in countries where factories are built. Kalmus and his family are a great example that they can still live in an ordinary life but  at the same time help reduce climate change. They grow their own food, live in a small house, and even drive a car that does not emit any CO2. One of the solutions to reduce climate change is to educate women this is not only an environmental problem but also an ongoing social issue.

<p>
This lecture video is a great summary of what we can do to save the planet, especially if you’re sharing it with someone that is passionate about climate change but doesn’t know where to start. Including what changes, such as becoming vegan or eating food that’s in season, that make the biggest difference is an important thing to list in my opinion. It allows someone to know where to focus their energy on what’s the most effective. I also appreciate that it was mentioned that the video was aimed at the developed world because we do have the largest carbon emissions. We are in the position to vote with our dollar as mentioned by Ken in the lecture video which I believe has a significant impact. Companies will produce cleaner goods if that’s what we demand. We do have to be aware of greenwashing and ways to prevent or see through it. 
     <br><br>
In addition, a lot of the actions mentioned in the video are already being done by those who are low-income. For example, food waste was never something that would happen in my household and we usually ate food that was in season because it was less expensive. The concept of minimalism is very much a privileged solution because I have never had the issue of having all of that purchasing power. It showed me the diversity of people involved in the effort to protect the environment which I largely appreciated. One-sided perspectives never make for practical solutions when it comes to problem solving. With that, I think we should have discussed environmental justice in this class more than we did. A large part of the climate crisis is that the people being affected by climate change are not those that have the resources to protect themselves or have received the benefits of the damage that has been done to the environment.

<p>

As Ken noted that eating locally and wasting less food can reduce lots of CO2 emissions, because CO2 is produced during the transportation of the food. Also, it is necessary to restrict the birth rate and educate women. Moreover, people should take public transportation to work rather than driving cars since making a car produce a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere. In addition, people can reduce their CO2 footprint by living in a co-housing or micro-apartments. Furthermore, they can choose to take slow travels instead of air travel. People not only should buy less stuff which is not necessary, but they also exchange and repair the stuff they own instead of discarding the stuff. 
      <br><br>
    Ken also highlighted the importance of taking collective action, and he listed some ways from the collective approach to mitigate the climate crisis. For example, vote for the candidates who intend to reverse the climate crisis and put people and the planet ahead of corporate interest. Persuading family and friends to take action is also necessary, and people should participate in some movement which means being activists. He also underscored people should learn more about the crisis and figure out what can be done to mitigate it. Furthermore, people need to revise their culture to make more and more people be aware of the crisis, and people should work together to solve the crisis.

This lecture managed to sum up pretty much everything we’ve talked about these past 9 weeks, and I agree that if I were to inform anyone about what we can do about climate change, I would link them to this. And I did! I’m actually glad this was the last lecture video because I didn’t want to send my friends a video every single week. Realistically, a person stops watching after the first video. I sent this video to two of my friends who are extremely pessimistic about climate change and we actually got to talk about everything on Saturday. Thankfully, this video not only made them feel more hopeful, but it actually made them want to look more deeply into solutions. One of them said she’d look at the course site! It’s amazing how much of an impact this class came to be and how accessible it is to anyone.
      <br><br>

As we get older, it’s extremely important for us to understand how both individual and political change impacts us when it comes to this crisis because prior to entering the class, I only had a small idea of that. Now being able to vote has made me feel empowered as well as knowing where to start before making lifestyle changes. While it's important to understand the severity of the climate crisis, it is even more important to be aware of solutions.

I think that this is one of the most important videos we’ve seen. At the beginning of the course I was feeling shitty about everything, as was the natural response to all the depressing information we were learning. I think it was important to end the course with hope. It's hard to make people want to do things if everything feels helpless. This video almost made me feel like we were at the cusp of something, like I had some power over how we move forward. I think it’s important for us to recognize ourselves as global citizens and do what we can at home base. 
       <br><br>

Its important to recognize that these videos are for people who are already aware of the issue. Legislation can help change the actions of those who are just too lazy, but have no ill intent with their actions. I agree that being able to vote has given me some power, or at least the feeling of power. I hope that everyone uses that power wisely.

After watching this lecture, I'm glad to learn so many solutions to help us reduce our carbon footprint. So many solutions cover all kinds of fields, which makes me understand that next, it should be changed. In this lesson, I learned that what really needs to change is the way we behave, so voting to express our views on climate issues is crucial. Only by letting most people know the severity of the climate crisis can the whole society make changes.

That was the point of this video! The biggest impact we can have on the environment is by starting to reevaluate our lives and figuring out the biggest impacts we can have on the environmental movement. This class has served as the foundation for our future-selves and the generations to come. We as a class of 900 may not have a huge impact on the world around us in the grand scheme of things, however, we must try as hard as possible to spread the activist bug. If we all are as passionate about the environment as we say we are, then we must act in the planet's best interests and take pieces of this class' teachings and incorporate them into our lives. The next step is working on convincing family members, then we can move onto our communities. Finally, onto the world!

8. Electric cars.
       <br><br>
9. Biking more.
       <br><br>
10. Walking more.

Though some of the 20 things that could be significant in relieving the climate crisis are already well known by the public, people still don’t understand that some actions are much easier to conduct than we normally think. Say stop wasting food is much easier than building thousands of solar panels, however, the effect of which is much more instant and profound than the latter. Considering anti-natalist policies and measures of contraceptions, these could also have a much more profound influence on the long-term condition of our climate. These actions could be very personal in terms of lifestyle choices, however, it may sound less appealing to those huge changes that often require billions of dollars to implement such as energy reform and the green new deal for example. I am particularly intrigued by the fact that people don’t usually value their own actions, therefore, some may turn to larger social issues and hence condemn institutions or the government to not take action. After learning all these things that we could do to alleviate the harm that we have done to our planet, I found myself in a very awkward situation. Even two months ago, I wasn’t even so aware of the harmful consequences of anthropogenic climate change. Now two months later, I am compelling myself to take action to alleviate it. WHAT COULD I REALLY DO? It is an important question for us, who well acknowledges this information and is keen to take action.

<p>
Again, thanks to Ken’s endless efforts during this quarter, putting uncountable efforts to let us know what’s our earth suffering now, and giving amounts of examples and personal experiences or suggestions for us to choose and think deeply. What we should do to save our planet? Every voice matters. And every step counts. Even though they are not that much effort put into climate protection, but unless we try our best and raise everyone’s awareness of the climate crisis. Our world will change magnificently. In the final lists of advice, I personally choose some of them and I believe I can insist on them later in the future by myself. Here, I just want to talk about myself, my goals of change, not others. I am a half-vegan, but I do eat fish or seafood. I think I will start quitting few of them and try to eat some farmed seafood. It would be impossible if I say I will give up all of them at once, but I would try my best to get my body used to the change of my diets little by little, and step by step, and hopefully I could leave the needs for those types of food eventually. At last but not least, about voting, I will vote for candidates who advocate for sweeping climate policies and also for those environmental initiatives.

Although this video is a summary of everything we’ve learned in this course, I definitely found it helpful to have everything in one place, explaining the numerous ways we really can have an impact in healing our planet. Talking about the climate crisis is often scary and disheartening, as it feels like we’re too far past the point of recovery. Because of this, this video is of central importance for people who feel too overwhelmed and belittled by the anthropogenic destruction of our planet. Each of the 20 ways to take action that Ken mentioned in the video applies to a different aspect of the climate crisis, from personal to collective action. Instead of focusing on everything wrong with the climate today, Ken draws our attention to what we can do to fix it. This issue is extremely pressing and time-sensitive, so it’s super important to not give up hope. If we don’t keep fighting for change, our planet will ultimately suffer the destruction we fear. 
       <br><br>

Not only is this list extremely useful in outlining clear steps we need to take in mitigating the climate crisis, but it gives us absolutely no excuse for inaction. Yes, Ken’s list highlighted 20 ways in which we can help the planet, but there are even more solutions and baby steps we can take that weren’t even mentioned in the video. People often view the climate crisis as too large to be solved by individual action, resulting in inaction and denial of the impact of climate change. I believe that inaction will prove to be the biggest hurdle in the battle against the climate crisis, and once people truly realize that there are things they can do to help, we have the power to heal our planet.

I completely agree. Having all of the ways to impact the climate in one list is reassuring. It shows that the climate crisis is not out of our reach. So many people that I talk to think that there is nothing that can be done, and that our earth is too far gone to be saved. This is just not the case. We can and must change our lifestyles to live in a more climate friendly way, and this will be done by using the compiled list. The list, containing personal and collective action, is the backbone of what our society needs to adopt. We need to get this list out to more than just the people enrolled in this class. This list could truly hold the key to people understanding that we can stop the climate crisis, but it has to be done by all. It also has to be done quickly. We do not have any time to waste. That is why it is imperative that we choose the right candidate in this election that supports the Green New Deal. 
       <br><br>

I can not agree more that the list makes us have no excuse for inaction. These changes range from simple, like using contraception and repairing items, to the less glamorous, like slow travel. Also, this list of twenty is not the only thing to follow. There are other things that can be done, in addition to the things on the list. We must get people to act on the climate crisis. We cannot stand by as our planet gets destroyed by humans. Just like with voting, people need to show up. People need to care about the future of generations to come. I will do my part in sending this video to many people, and I hope this creates a domino effect. People must change, and a simple start to this would be watching this video and getting inspired.

Like Ken mentioned in the lecture, this video is definitely one I’d share with others in order to further inform them about the steps they can take to help mediate the climate crisis. While it was critical that past lecture videos went more in depth on specific issues, such as the lessons devoted to flying, food consumption, or voting, I enjoyed how this video summed everything up as well as included a few additional solutions. The separation of these 20 things into two sets of 10s highlights how solving the climate crisis requires BOTH personal action as well as political and collective activism, as they go hand in hand. 
       <br><br>
I also appreciate how Ken emphasized the importance of prioritizing which things people should focus on first. To many people who are not as familiar with the topics previously covered in class, this list may seem a little overwhelming at first and may leave people not knowing where to start. However, by stressing the importance of not just voting, but making an informed vote for the good of the planet, the video gives us an impactful place to begin a more environmentally conscious lifestyle. Furthermore, he explains why more mainstream solutions involving technology are not necessarily the most effective, which may save many people from relying too much on new innovations.

Hi, I also believe that this lecture is worth sharing to others as it lists solutions based on our personal and political actions in order to help climate crisis. The way the solutions are listed is very clear to understand and can digest the information easily. If we can follow at least one of these options, I think it can lead to bigger and greater changes in the future. With each choice you make, you advertise the emergency needed about this issue. All actions- ranging from your household to political choices- rings an alarm inside all of us that might wake us up one day from our blindness and build a management for the necessary change we have been lacking.

I really like how this lecture conveys how some really simple things can actually go a long way for the environment. This class and English 22 have really inspired me to change and be more mindful in sustainability. I was really excited to have the option to bring a car to school next year, but now I do not want to because biking or walking is  a very realistic option here and there are buses if I want to go anywhere farther. Also, the dining hall actually makes it really easy to eat less meat. There are always vegan and vegetarian meal options and the salad bar is really nice. Living at home, I usually opt for the easiest meal options, which are often not vegetarian or vegan, but here, I frequently choose to eat plant based since I do not have to make my own food. The dining halls also frequently have information on sustainability and the carbon footprints of different food items. Living in a dorm is also good because three people are sharing a small space, and I have realized that it really is not that difficult to live in close quarters, prompting me to be much more open to the idea of a tiny house or apartment in the future. We also have to be more mindful of how much we own because there is such little space. Furthermore, there are many good thrift stores in the area that I really enjoy going to and finding cool and unique clothing items for cheap prices and while being environmentally friendly. On another note, having many places where we could go to vote on Super Tuesday really encouraged more people to vote since it was so accessible and a lot of people were very excited about it. Thus, I think we are truly in a great environment to make changes and get used to these changes in college before graduating, then we can continue to implement these changes in the future.

I really enjoyed your comment because I totally related to how your living situation was when I was a freshman. You are totally correct, where the dining commons make it really easy to be plant-based. Although I have been a vegetarian for about 7 years I am not completely plant-based and could definitely benefit from reducing my carbon footprint by becoming vegan. When I was living in the dorms with the accessible dining commons I would eat mostly vegan and just as you said there was an excellent salad bar. However, since I have moved out of the dorms I have definitely been less conscious of what I eat since I have been going out to restaurants a lot more often. Of course, this is no excuse because I could just order meals that are vegan but it is quite easy to buy things with dairy products especially when going out to eat. After taking this class I am going to try to make meals instead at home which also creates less waste and gear towards a plant-based diet. Another thing I related to you was bringing my car. This year I brought my car in order to work at a restaurant downtown. I know that it is very horrible driving all the way there by myself in my car but if I were to work in IV where I can ride my bike it would be extremely difficult to make enough money to cover my rent and tuition. An alternative choice I could make is taking a bus downtown to work however with my school schedule I barely have enough time to make it to work each day in my own car so it would be quite difficult taking the bus. This is probably my weakness when it comes to reducing my carbon emissions so I try to make it up in other regions such as my diet and my consumerism.

It's very interesting to see how you are willing to change your habits or what you planned on doing for the betterment of the environment and it shows that with the education that change can truly occur. It's just interesting to see how much information your dining halls provide that information as that can help people think on how they contribute in emissions, just where I live the cafe where we eat doesn't do that and the other one that's available only mentions composting, but the last visit there the bin was gone. As a freshman, I've been adjusting but thinking about what I can do to contribute to a cleaner Earth, one of them is biking and busing as my main forms of transportation on campus and when I've been in a car it's been my friend's and there's been a group of us (isn't often in the car though). Thrifting is something I would love to start doing more, but it's hard to find places with good options, but I've been to one out here and found some nice things, but back home I'm like what is going on as most things are not conventional for my needs with length and size or even style. Overall, it was great seeing how enthusiastic you are about hopes for a better future and mentioning voting was great for you to do, I also feel that voting is super important and should be made more accessible with fewer complications as some states have certain rules making the process more difficult.
<br><hr>
I love how you broke this down and related these applications to UCSB specifically. There are so many ways to practice these 20 things through resources already provided to us on campus. I have begun to choose alternatives to things that I used to find important to me, such as having a car or eating a burger. I think that even small change in our personal lives makes a huge impact on our community. And our community can also make small changes in us. Because UCSB is so bike friendly, we are able to produce much less emissions than most universities. This is something I pride myself on. And our dining halls attempt to push going green as well, and even though one day a week is a small change, it’s something that demonstrates positive reinforcement of making these decisions. Living in a dorm is a great way to open ourselves up to living in smaller quarters. And we are pushed to get out and vote not just by the university but also by our peers! I am so happy that our community can come together in these ways to promote true happiness and provide easy alternatives to thinks we may see as necessary.
<br><hr>
This class has also changed my views on the environment. I grew up around climate change denial, but the evidence presented in this class is too strong to ignore. Even the first reading we had caused me to fear for our future. I won’t stop driving because it’s the only way I can get anywhere safely in my hometown with few bike lanes, but I will definitely be reducing the amount of time I drive as feasibly as possible. I’ve never been to a thrift store, but now that you mention it, it would be good to try at least once. I already wear clothes until they’re ragged, so this will be even more carbon efficient. Santa Barbara is a very easy place to try to make a change. There is so much activism and environmentally friendly options, I hope we do adopt these habits before we leave.

<br><hr>
I also enjoyed this lecture, I thought it was concise and straight to the point. Like you, I have been inspired by this course and by Kenneth Hiltner. This course has really opened my eyes on climate change. I have been influenced to incorporate less meat in my diet and to use my car less. I agree with you on that the dining halls have so much variety. When I first started eating at the dining commons, I was impressed that there were so many vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free recipes. Not only was I encouraged to try different types of foods but it also encouraged me to eat more healthy. To be honest, I think I eat healthier at school than when I’m at home. When I’m at home, I usually can’t find the energy or motivation to cook so I always opt for eating out. 
       <br><br>

Living in a dorm has also taught me that no one needs to live in a large place. I shared my room with two other girls, and it did feel cramped sometimes but we managed. If I survived in a triple for a full year, I think I can manage living in a smaller apartment or house. But living in a triple did make me realize how much things I owned. Since our space was so limited, our closets and drawers were so full. I realize now that I did not need that much stuff, I can’t recall ever opening my desk drawers that much. Being a full time student has made me realize that we can all live comfortably while not harming the environment. These four years will teach me that we don’t need to rely on cars, meat, or large spaces.

I am so glad that I finish the learning of English23 after the introduction of the climate crisis last fall quarter, English22. I think this site of classes was so fun and inspiring. I know that Ken has worried about the repetition of the same concepts in this class. However, I think this repetition of those basic concepts is rather important. When I first entered this class in English22, when Ken mentioned about wasting food and housing problems for the first time, I didn’t think too much of it. Then, with English23, the re-learn of those basic ideas really changed my life. Now, every time I went to the dining hall, I think about the carbon footprints of what I eat. Every time I took the bus, I think that this is good transportation while considering global warming. Every time I want to buy new things, I think about how long can I use this and Do I really need this? I believe this is a kind of cultural change that Ken once addressed in this class. I am changing because of the repetitive appearance of those ideas. In the future, my friends are going to notice my change and ask me. At that time, I will be able to convey these ideas to them, and they would probably change too. Yes! In this class, Ken has also taught us how to communicate that to your friends. Thus, this class basically has everything that you need if you want to know the situation of climate crisis now and if you want to make a change.
       <br><br>

I once took a course called EEMB 22 W. It’s also an online course that addresses this environmental issue from a biological perspective. In the end, Professor Thomas Even concludes that “act locally, influence globally.” I think this is exactly what we should do. Don’t doubt because you think your personal action won’t mean that much. Act first and everything will change.

" Act locally, influence globally" I really like this saying, and we can see the consistency of Profesor Ken's ideology of doing small things and then encourage others to do the same in order to change the environment. This is indeed an inspiring class, especially today's lecture on the 20 things that we can do. We should definitely focus on the 10 individual things first. I am amazed by how you changed your lifestyle and think about the environment, looks like you have stepped ahead already and I think that is where I should be aiming for in life. 
       <br><br>
I do agree that Ken has taught us a lot, especially a lot of concepts and on how we communicating those concepts to others. However, I still think that some of the concepts are quite unreasonable for most of the people regarding our lives. Like air travel or eating habits. It is inevitable for air travel, even the presidents of different countries. And do we necessarily need to be a vegan or vegetarian, cause you know a plant-based eating habit may be harmful to your health within the change of time. And Ken only addressed the negative effects of animal farming, to be honest, plants can be harmful to the environment as well. For example, vegan's favorite fruit --- Avocado.
       <br><br>
Ken's ideas and concepts are definitely stunning and outstanding. There is a long way to go on and much and much more debates on the change of lifestyles.

This lecture was a great recap of the course, in leaving us with the things to remember even when we are finished with the course to help fight against the climate crisis. I have actually tried a vegetarian diet this week and it was not as difficult as I thought it would be. Also, the approach to having too much stuff is something I will try to implement more as I have a lot of things I do not use on a daily basis.

In this video "Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet", Ken introduced 20 things from two perspectives: individual actions and collective or political actions as a recap of this course. In "Cowspiracy",  we are encouraged to switch to largely plant-based diets, however it turns out that there are more issues that causes green house gas emissions and it is definitely not enough to solve climate crisis. What's more, wasting less food is as important as being vegans.  And limited family size, movement to a micro apartment or co-housing, public transportation, choice of slow travel over air travel, minimalism, and many things could save this planet to a large extent, which are what we should follow.

In college, I have been implementing the rule of:walk or bike instead of driving, or use a car minimally
       <br><br>
I find it quite relaxing to walk to class, and biking as more efficient than I thought it would be. You can bike to class in under 5 minutes and it is a nice workout as well. It is easy to sacrifice your comfort for the sake of the environment, especially when it is beneficial to your health at the same time. Carbon dioxide emissions is a leading cause to the climate crisis, and small changes are key to seeing gradual progress in our environment.

Agreed, I'm glad you taken up a change in your daily routine, hopefully you continue to make more conscious choices like such.
       <br><br>

Biking in general is soothing. I understand the thrill of driving a car but riding my bike on a lazy Friday afternoon hits differently ya know. I didn't realize how environmentally friendly biking truly is until this class and it has only made me love my bike more and push for a better bicycle lane infrastructure.
       <br><br>
In my case, the most recent change I have done in regards to the climate crisis is I've given up red meats for lent (I'm trying to give up all meats but sometimes the dining commons don't have the best options). So I've recently taken up a more fruit and plant base diet. It does take more planning and time but honestly UCSB has a pretty good vegetarian options, fruits and veggies that are easily accessible. Although, I made this decision because of my religious background I'm not exaggerating when I say I plan on continuing this type of diet from now on; a climaterian diet.

As a final lecture, I think this video sums up the course, just not how I would want it to. I truly think that every one of the ways that we can make personal and collective change is directly related to political action and voting. We do not have enough cognizance of what is needed when voting for officials, and it shows in the fact that we do not have very many politicians who see environment as a central focus of their campaigns – partly because the American public doesn’t care that much. I think that all of the things that we could do, or that we should do collectively can be heavily influenced (supported) by political means (taxation, incentives, etc.) and should be the main way in which we are working to collectively solve our environmental issues. I do not see an environmentally conscious future trying to work via collective action, because the American public has shown to not be driven to do much, however I believe we must work to form a political system which swiftly implements policies indiscriminately to ensure that we quickly transition to a lower carbon economy and system.

This lecture video contains a lot of useful information. As Ken said, it can be the review video for the final, and the best one to share with others. The 20 things Ken listed are actually really simple and each of them is related. This video actually recalls the memory of what I learned in this class. Looking at the statistic Ken gives to, ⅓ of greenhouse gas are due to food production, 85 million unintended pregnancies every year, 25% of climate footprint comes from owning a car, and so on. The things Ken mentioned are actually small and people always ignore them. But combining with those numbers, changing your life habits is significant. I have told to my mom many times, eat less meat, drink less milk. She told me, even if she did, other people are doing it. My words were stuck after this. And today’s video, Ken said VOTE. Yes, I believe voting is the way to solve this problem. But I always ask myself that does voting really that useful? It is really hard to call a nation’s fossil fuel companies to stop, Republicans disagree with it, those RICH fossil fuel companies disagree with it, and even people who were benefited or worked under those companies will not say yes. I clearly know that the US still has a long period to adjust, to act, but I have hope.

This lecture video was a perfect way to finish out the course materials as it truly encapsulated the entirety of what an average person can do to help save the environment, a perfect instruction guide for a student like me looking into the future of trying to help advocate and save the planet. Every different thing that Ken mentions in this video is inspiring and are not difficult ways to make a change for our earth. I have learned so much about the environment throughout this course and have gained a much greater understanding of how to actually make a change. I hope that this video, among the dozens of other films readings and lectures that we have watched have truly educated and inspired other students as much as it has for me. I believe that the knowledge Ken has given us can save our planet if only we can advocate and spread these easy ways we can help with our friends, family, and literally anyone that will listen! Thank you Ken!

I really appreciated this all-encompassing lecture as the quarter draws to a close, to serve as not only a review for the final but a reminder of the important topics we learned. I plan to print out the summarized list of twenty things and pin it up to my bulletin board to act as a daily reminder to in some way make an effort to lower my emissions that day. My biggest hope is that after we all finish this class and move on with our lives, that we don’t let these calls to action slip from our minds as time goes on. This lecture is one that I believe I can come back to a few months down the line for a good refresher, or to share with friends and family as educational material. The twenty minutes also gave me time to reflect on the course as a whole, and I find myself quite sad that it’s over. Ken if you’re reading this, please offer another environmental/climate crisis related class because I’d love to take it!

I also appreciated how everything Ken has said up until this point has all led to this lecture. With all the information he has given us regarding the technical, cultural, and ecological aspects of climate change have finally developed enough so that we can begin to form solutions from it in many different aspects of life. For example, voting for environmental initiatives can help us witness change on a much larger scale, while individual actions like reducing meat consumption and riding bikes instead of driving cars can help on the community level. If we can begin to apply these various solutions to all aspects of life, then maybe we can create a society sustainable enough to where we can have our children not worry about if they will survive the over-heating of the Earth. This one, last message from Ken was truly inspiring, and I must say, I'm much more motivated to change my lifestyle in the name of our planet.

I liked how this video was a review that referenced all the films and readings and tied them altogether in a clear list. Sometimes I feel like all this info is repetitive, but with this list I can clearly differentiate and connect all the information in my head to these 20 overarching ideas. To me, the most important step is number 16. I think many statistics are thrown around and we are very quick to accept them. Without no regard to figure out who conducted these surveys and test, it is essential that we make sure these numbers are accurate and coming from a reflective sample of a large size. All of these "averages" I am sure could be much higher and could possibly make people more fearful of this issue. When people see the numbers of corona virus cases, they go into panic mode and stock up on supplies for survival. If the climate change issue got as much attention, we could be instilling fear and a call to action across the globe. Before this can happen however, we must think about step 16, reading and educating ourselves about the issue. It is not good to hyperbolize the situation, with clear, reliable facts, we can turn the Uncle Pete's of the world into sustainable people. There really is no need to hyperbolize the situation, the facts are so shocking as is. The information in its rawest form may even come across as extreme and made up. Or possibly can make people feel hopeless. Instead we must instill fear as the corona virus has. People are taking it seriously out of fear. If people were hopeless about the situation, people would not be wiping Costco clean of toilet paper. I think by pulling more on the facts and exposing the scary reality of it all, we could get people to take it more seriously and not see it as an inevitable reality. The solutions must be voiced more to show that there are things we can do. However, like Ken has said, personal change is not enough, we need to get people in power to enact the changes we want to see. By voting, we can elect the right people in power to get the job done. Knowing this, we all must be active to learn about the candidates and what they stand for. I know so many young voters who just vote for whoever their parents tell them too.  But, our parent's generation have different priorities. As w have discusses, people of Ken's generation rank climate change low on the priority list. For this reason, young voters need to be active in learning about the candidates before election day in order to make the most out of their vote. There is always the issue of convincing people that their vote matters. Many of my friends have not registered until I forced them. to because they do not think that their vote even matters. I see how it seems that way, but we must break that stigma and increase voter turnout! If this can happen, maybe there is hope for our democracy.

I also think that this video is a good summary of everything that has been discussed or shown in this course, including all the readings, films, lecture videos, and in-class lectures. Even though a lot of information has been repeated throughout the course, I forget facts relatively quickly so it is good to have a refresher of the most important aspects to take away from these past few weeks.  It is also good to break down how anyone who is concerned about climate change can help with both individual and collective action. I can see how some of the collective action initiatives can be implemented just based on the comments on this video alone as many people are talking about how they will send this video to friends and family. Moreover, since the people taking this course are educated on these matters, it becomes easier to help spread the knowledge to others which results in the collective action aspect.

I am very grateful that I chose to take this course at the beginning of the quarter; this class changed my viewpoint on how my lifestyle should be and how the certain choices that I make can make a meaningful difference. Prior to taking this course I did not have the knowledge of the climate crisis and quite frankly I thought it was a hoax. But now that I have had the information taught to me I have a completely different viewpoint. After watching this lecture video and as he was explaining each solution I was able to understand a deeper meaning to each of the topics that we can do to help the planet. I am grateful for this because (topic # 18: sharing what we know) I can now teach those around me and hopefully make a greater change to ultimately decrease the amount of CO2 that is ruining the planet earth. I plan to take the following personal steps: number one being that I will consume less and what I do consume I will use all of the product in some manner whether it be compost or simply just eating an entire vegetable. This comes will decrease in portion size because not only is it healthier to eat only what your stomach can hold but it will also help the amount of food produced to feed us. Second, I plan to switch to a climatarian lifestyle and I embrace the opportunity to share my experience with others so that they too can consider the possibility. I am appreciative that I have the knowledge on contraceptives and how important it is to make smart decisions. Thirdly, I plan to commute to class and to my future job with the use of a bike and invest in a nicer bike so that I will have incentive to use it. Fourth, I will be living in cohousing and I hope to implement our own garden and compost area. Fifth, I choose to travel in a slow manner and to consolidate my dream places to go in one larger one. Lastly, I want to live a minimalist lifestyle and understand that life is more than having cute clothes or more stuff. 
       <br><br>
I think it’s important to understand that the climate crisis is not only a personal issue but an even greater collective issue and we need to find a way to take it on all together. From this lecture video I plan to take the following steps to cultivate collective action: first, I plan to take the 1-2 hours out of my year to vote for those who are in support of aspects that will benefit this planet and who I think will truly take action. Second, I venture upon the opportunity to educate others on this issue and I will try and cultivate community joinings to ultimately make a greater change. Thirdly, I will continue to read as much as I can on this subject and keep myself informed and show others that there is a deeper meaning to the things that they read that are surrounding the subject of the climate crisis. Lastly, I know that I will join with others to make our voices heard of our concerns and what we have to do as a generation to change what the previous generation has created. Overall, I am so grateful to now have the knowledge that I do coming out of this class so I can begin my journey on living for the planet Earth and provide for others.

I could not agree more... taking this class was truthfully a transformational experience. Through all this information that we have learned over the course of the quarter, my mindset has taken a turn for the better. I enjoyed this video because it acted kind of as a summary for all the practical actions we can take to make a difference in the future of humanity on Earth. It's a good way to wrap up all of the key ideas hat we've learned from each lecture, film, and reading. I plan on checking up on this list often so that I don't just let these advisories go to waste but rather, to ACTION.

I enjoyed how this video summarized all the information we have learned this quarter in a clear and straightforward way. It specifically focuses on actions that we, as individuals, can take in order to reduce the harmful effects of the climate crisis. Most of these are easy to do and do not require major life changes, such as repairing items rather than buying new ones, purchase from environmentally sound companies, vote, etc. I also think it was very important how Ken mentioned at the end of the video that the poorest 3 billion of people in this planet only account for 5% of greenhouse gases, reinforcing how the wealthy ones are mainly responsible for climate change. Therefore, it makes sense that we should expect the wealthy to be the ones leading these efforts that are outlined in the video. Not only because developed nations are the ones more responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, but also because these countries are more likely to have the means to do so through actions such as establishing sources of renewable energy and making this transition.

I agree with your point that wealthier and privileged people should put more focus towards making changes because they have the means to do so. Obviously, this doesn't mean that if you're rich or powerful, you're expected to contribute. It's simply just more realistic to use resources in order to spread awareness as well as provide help to existing organizations or activists. However, even without money or power, it's still possible to do so. It's more of a matter of wanting to step up or not, and that's entirely up to you.

I found this video a very good recap of the quarter. Contrast to what other comments have to say about the length of this video, I think it’s a reasonable time for an introduction to climate change. For someone who’s new to the subject they’d find this video informational and interesting enough to finish through. I like how Professor Hiltner separated the list into individual and collective actions. Ken is making it very easy for us to choose to take action in the climate crisis. This course emphasizes the accessibility to all the different types of action one can easily take, the variety. Wrapping it all up, this would be a perfect introductory video for those who are wishing to understand or be more involved.

It's a long list, but it is completely manageable. Imagine if we all did it -- suddenly the impact increases 600x. And you have to take into account that changing your actions has a ripple effect on the people around you, such that one person going vegan, for example, will likely cause at least one other person to go vegan, and so on. It is so refreshing to hear new, interesting, challenging yet rewarding ways to combat the climate crisis. I think a lot of people have become tired of constant reminders to recycle and conserve energy, to the extent that those practices have lost their urgency. I needed this fresh wave of inspiration, something tangible to take with me after learning so many devastating and disturbing things about what is happening in the world today.
       <br><br>

I'm so glad I took this class. Ken himself is a great example of someone who makes personal environmental changes (like becoming a climatarian, not flying, etc) and also dedicates his career to public activism, through education. Not everyone can nor will do that, but our generation will need a lot of people to step up in this way quickly if we are going to make a difference. I feel hopeful that if we remain engaged the way we are now, continue to educate ourselves, and proceed to take action, we can beat climate change. Which is saying a lot.

This lecture video was the perfect way to tie together the whole course. It gives a concise but detailed explanation on what we can, as individuals and as a population, do to help the environment and try to combat the climate crisis. It is also the perfect video to show to family and friends who are curious about this subject. As we learned in last week’s lecture video, only share this information if they ask about it, as people get overwhelmed very easily. As individuals, here are the ten things we can do: eat a plant-based diet (vegan, freegan and/or climatarian) and limit food waste, be conscious about our food choices, use contraception and implement family planning, educate boys and girls equally, walk, bike or use public transportation instead of driving, live mindfully (smaller houses, co-housing), avoid air travel by choosing to slow travel (trains, buses, driving), practice some form of minimalism, repair or rent instead of buying new things, and buy from companies with environmentally-sound and socially just practices. Many of these changes are easy fixes that I believe we can all implement to some extent in our life. Although it may be hard to religiously go by all ten, I’d say it is easily feasible to go by at least five. For me, the only really hard one is air travel, as my whole family lives in Europe. As far as the others go, many I have already implemented into my life, and others I’m making an active effort to. 
       <br><br>
Collectively and politically, here are the ten things we can do: vote for candidates who advocate for sweeping climate policies, vote for environmental initiatives, spread the word about the climate crisis, and explain solutions and the importance of voting, gather and create powerful groups of activists and change-makers, protest and take power away from enemies of the environment, read and educate ourselves about skills we can take on, think about why this is so important in order to maintain or revitalize our passion for the cause, use knowledge to share and implement solutions, join initiatives such as freegan and bicycle collectives to create a larger support system for the climate crisis, and finally, as Gandhi once beautifully said, be the change you want to see in the world. I believe these collective actions may be easier for some than the individual actions. As Ken mentioned in the lecture video, one of the most important actions is also the one that takes the least amount of time, and that is voting. It only takes one to two hours per year, and makes the most sweeping difference. Without politicians in office who advocate for environmental initiatives, very little will ever get done. Finally, I believe staying optimistic and inspired, and constantly thinking about Gandhi’s quote, are the only way we will get through this.

What an amazing video summarizing the 20 most important calls to action and putting together many of the things we have learned about the climate crisis during the past 9 weeks. I have learned so many things about the climate crisis that I never knew before. Many of the things I learned were things that are quite obvious, but they are not talked about enough in our daily discussions on the news and with other people that it just slips our mind. These are things such as the global greenhouse gas emissions from the production of cars, the emissions from planes, and the emissions from having children. This class has also shown me ways to live an eco-friendly lifestyle and the ability to envision the United States as a democratic socialist country like the Scandinavian countries. Even before taking this class, I admired and looked up to the ways of life and culture of Scandinavian countries and their Nordic Model, but always thought I would have to travel to those countries to experience their values. After having learned more about how to incorporate their types of living (i.e. cohousing, biking, education and healthcare for all) as well as learning more about the ways in which politics in America is trying to implement similar systems and infrastructure through the Green New Deal and Carbon Tax, it’s very exciting to think that maybe the United States CAN embody similar values like theirs. 
       <br><br>

After everything I’ve learned from this class, I am still not confident in my ability to communicate and debate about the climate crisis with those who are not already on board with the movement. I think this is something I will get better at with practice, and I intend to bring up this conversation when my family members ask me how my quarter went during Spring Break. I might even try to make a facts sheet that I can pull out when I share what I’ve learned with my family.

I agree that this class has enlightened me on the impact that I and many other people are having on the environment, while teaching me many ways with which I could reduce said impact.  I never knew about how much danger we were in, and what could happen to the earth in the near future if we did not begin to act.  I’ve begun to implement this knowledge into my daily life.  For example, I used to drink water from disposable plastic bottles, but I recently bought a hydro flask, which I fill with filtered tap water.  This class has made me care more about our planet, and I also plan to spread this knowledge to my family at home.

All of these 20 things make a significant change in our carbon footprints. Twenty different things to do may sound like a lot, but focusing on one or few at a time could definitely make it easier for me at least. For example, voting for those who push to focus on climate change is very easy, along with creating groups looking to reduce climate change. It is difficult when the changes are lifestyle changes like reducing driving a car and eating a vegan diet. This is very tough for me but I'm open to committing myself towards this in the near future.

I really liked the lecture this week because it was a great review and it is also something we can share with whoever we want. It is such a great way of spreading the word and encouraging change. It is also nice to be reminded of all the things we have learned over the course of this class. Overall this video is such a great resource. Learning more about the climate crisis is crucial in order to talk about it with other people (as we learned in last week's reading), so I am grateful for getting to learn both more about it and the new things I found out along the way. It was really cool to see how everything we have read and watched has all been tied together in this video.

I really appreciated your comment for a couple of reasons. Firstly, in the first sentence of her comment, she writes that this is a video that we can share with whoever we want. Throughout the course, Hiltner has advocated for this sharing and spreading of climate change information. He asked us to share the syllabus and his YouTube channel with family members and friends. I shared these with my mom the first week of class and she was ecstatic to have the ability to view this information and be a part of my college education. Even in this video itself, Hiltner again discusses the importance of sharing our knowledge so that our family and friends have a better understanding of the climate crisis and what must be done. Secondly, I also agree that this video is an outstanding resource to study for the final. It ties together so many course concepts and themes, as well as films and readings. I would also like to add that this video is also an amazing resource to come back to in the future because of how specific it is and because of how much material it covers so quickly.

I really enjoyed this lecture video as it gave us 20 concise ways that we can do both personally and politically to save not only ourselves but the other life on this planet. One of the points Ken made was about not buying an excessive amount of food. We are seeing this happen with the developing case of the COVID-19. People are hoarding supplies and food and it's scary to think what would happen here in Santa Barbara if it ever gets here. These people cannot possibly eat all this food without it going bad and it's just a waste of food that could have been avoided.
<br><br>

I’ve always felt like I was not doing enough to help fight climate change but it turns out I was already doing a lot of the suggestions that Ken was mentioning. But I came to the realization that a lot of these solutions save a lot of money, and coming from a low income background, I had no choice. It made me realize that sometimes it is the poor who have more to lose in this fight against climate change that are doing the most in the fight. For example, Ken talks about reproduction control, sharing, thrifting, and getting educated among other things.These are all big issues in my low income family as we realized how much we can save by doing these things. Now for me this has shifted from not only a financial reason but for the benefit of the all the life on Earth. If it wasn't for the education that I am getting here at UCSB I would have never learned about my carbon footprint or just how important my vote and that of my families could be in these elections. I am grateful and understand in the position of the privilege that I am and hope to be able to use this to educate my family and my friends.

Yeah I can agree with a lot here. My family is not so well off and seeing that I can save money really made eye light up. all of these 20 solutions were straight to the point. I too felt like I was not doing enough. Coming to UCSB has given the grand opportunity to actually make a difference in my community.

In this particular lecture video, Hiltner does a great job of recapping all the different things we learned we can do to help further prevent climate change. After watching this video, I have become more motivated to share with my friends and family back at home what I have learned from this class. Hiltner is definitely right when he says knowledge is only power when acted upon and talk is cheap. By sharing this information with my family, I hope they will become more mindful of the planet when doing everyday things like grocery shopping or buying stuff in general. I also hope I can lead by example where I can with my own personal actions such as eating more plant-based foods, being more minimalistic, not having a lot of kids and etc. Throughout the lecture video, I thought the rhetoric was clever with how Hiltner showed us different places, other than the breakfast table, where we can save the planet. I also enjoyed how he split up the list of twenty into two lists, personal actions and collective political actions. Overall, I think I will be showing this video to friends and family members! I think they’ll feel refreshed about how this climate change video centers on what we can do rather than making them feel hopeless about our situation.

I also think Ken did a great job pulling all the previous tips together. This video is well organized, and it is also a great reminder for each of us to take action and treat them seriously. It is difficult to accomplish all the tips, but is fairly easy to do most of them. It is sad we are at the point of history that we must do something to reverse the negative impacts we have done in the past that are detrimental to the earth. The U.S. is the biggest economy in the world, thus we have the biggest responsibility to create a better earth. I feel sad that the U.S. is the number one contributor to the greenhouse emissions, but all of them are in past tense. What we have done is history, and now we all have the new opportunity to do something, to do something for our planet, to do something for our future generations, to do something for our civilization.
 <br><br>

Again, this video emphasized transportations. There are too many cars in the United States, and other countries. It makes me panic that buying a Tesla does not solve the problem. I think maybe we do need to consider bikes or electric bikes again, because they are clean! I am very glad that most of the students at UCSB commute by bike. I am really proud to be one of them. Every trip we bike means less carbon dioxide is emitted to the atmosphere. Carbon footprint is very hard to get rid of. I want to say that voting is a great way to express our ideas in the U.S. Many countries in the world do not have the privileges of voting. We are lucky to have this opportunity, and please use this opportunity wisely. Every ballot matters, and we need to do it quickly!

This whole video basically sums up all the things we need to do, both in our personal lives and in activism, in order to help our planet becoming a much greener place. But this whole video is not just a recap of the class, but a good overview of the list and simplifying all the aspects so that anyone who watches this can understand what kind of things will reduce our carbon footprint. Sure, it is longer than most of the lecture videos, but it is straight to the point and easy to follow along. Even though we are getting closer and closer to the end of the quarter, this was a great video to remind us that all this heavily detail information about the meat industry, fossil fuel industry, minimalism, etc. is more simple and the actions we can take are just as simple as the information given to us from this video. So thank you Ken for an amazing quarter and making me want to become a better citizen for not just my country, but for our world.

 <br><br>

Starting with personal action, I am slowly - but surely - will be developing a better lifestyle to reduce the carbon emissions in the air. I have luckily been using mass transportation and/or walking much more often to get to the places I need to be, I have been trying to have a minimalistic perspective on all the clothes that I have and resisting the urge to buy new merchandise from my favorite celebrities just because it "their brand", and I have been thinking about getting a micro-apartment once I am done with college! However, I still have a long way to go in practicing my meal habits of beef and overestimating the amount of food I will be eating, but at least I am being aware of the amount of carbon I am putting into the air just by wasting food and slowly putting out less and less food waste after I eat my meal. Now with activism, I have began to use my voice to advocate who should be placed in government to help make our world a much greener place and have been practicing activism through protesting and educating myself on environmental issues. This class helped me open my mind to so much knowledge about our planet and the amount of carbon emissions and damage we have already done to the world. I thought I knew enough to be a proper activist, but boy this class proved me wrong. But now with these 20 tips and having a whole quarter about learning the ins and outs of climate change, I think I am now ready to change the planet, one step at a time.

In this lecture, Ken wraps up the course by giving a brief overview of the top 20 actions we can take, individually and collectively, to help fight against the climate crisis. I thought this lecture was a great takeaway for the course, as it summarizes in an easy way the most important things we can do, and addresses our own personal lifestyle choices as well as at larger community, national, and global levels. I think the most plausible changes I could make to my own life, after learning about many in this class, are probably reducing my meat consumption and food waste and participating politically. I hope when I get to a more stable place in the future - with work, school and life in general - I can try to reduce my driving and flying habits. Ken, and this class, have really taught me the environmental consequences of air travel - something I wasn’t aware of before. This lecture left me feeling inspired for the future, and feeling knowledgeable enough to go and teach others what I have learned. Like we’ve discussed, and as Ken stated in #17,  I believe the real most important thing is a sense of passion and purpose in changing our beliefs and lifestyles. We must truly want the change, we must truly feel passionate about the cause, we must find meaning in making these transformations.

I think this video was interesting because it really sums up everything this class has taught me and the ways we can pursue a sustainably friendly culture through small action. Before taking this class, I only knew of the obvious ways like becoming vegan and taking public transportation. But there is more to it, I learned that educating young girls and women can help the planet, that living in the city, or any small housing has an impact as well. I learned that being active and voting for people with the same values in politics is crucial to a longer future. This video has really emphasized that anyone can do it, and it can start with the little things. Saving the planet should be the top priority for all of us and it cannot wait any longer. It's crazy how many catastrophes humans have caused to our home, and to the animals and plants also living on it. Every day, a species becomes extinct. Every day, we are straying farther from a thriving culture. And it is because of that, that we have to take this video seriously. One of the disappointing things I learned in this class was that America contributes to 2/3 carbon emissions of the global population, so we have an even larger responsibility to change our ways. Ken opens up a general discussion about what we've learned in this class and now it is up to us to listen. He gave us a list of ways to save the planet, and now we need to apply it to our own lives. The planet will continue to thrive whether humans aren't or are on it. So it is really our choice if we want to continue on our path of destruction or if we want to be on the path for a longer future. Another thing I found cool in this video was that the things Ken suggested don't just save the planet, but they address other issues like equal education, being a community, and so on. The future can be a scary place but if we take preventions and make the right choices, it can be something to look forward to.

I like this summarized list. It is amazing to think that we were able to completely cover all of these things in detail in just eight weeks. We have truly gone over, extensively, over a enormous amount of material in a very short time. When I signed up for this course, I knew this and allotted time accordingly. However, the majority of the workforce does not have this amount of free time, and more than likely the desire, to spend around 6 hours of their weeks dedicated to climate change. Precisely, this is the power of this video. I sort of see it as the environmentalist hacker manual. It is a video that anyone can watch or listen to in a very short amount of time. It is short enough  to be listened to on the train, in traffic or even while doing groceries. However, it has the power to inspire and educate thousands of new environmentalists. I think this video should be spread as much as possible and should be included in the k-12 healthy habits unit. This video is truly applicable to anyone.

<br><br>
Looking back at who I was eight weeks ago, I can truly say that this course has impacted me for the better. I have developed new habits that not only reflect positively on the plant, but on myself as well. I voted for the first time, on a candidate I would have previously more than likely not voted for. Just voting, I don't think I would have gone out to vote without the encouragement of this class. Additionally, I altered my diet and started reading more. This class has truly changed me as a person and I will always be grateful for that.

Thank you for sharing! I liked the summarized list as well. Ken said at the beginning of the video that this may sound a bit redundant and I can say that I think that it was, however what that really means is that I have learned so much from taking this course! Listening to this video and nodding my head along while taking notes, entirely understanding of every point he was making made me feel really good. Similar to what you are saying, in this short time that we have had we really have gone over an extensive amount of information, and I feel like the information that I have learned has actually stuck with me. I have talked to a lot of my friends and family about what I have been learning so far this quarter and I feel like this video would be the perfect re-cap to show them as an initial rundown. If they have questions I can then direct them to other videos that break this down into more detail. Like you said as well, this class has changed me as a person and I have found myself to be making much healthier decisions for the planet and for myself! As Ken says, knowledge is only power when acted upon and I think he successfully passed along this knowledge to students that are now acting.

This is actually one of the very few courses I've taken at UCSB that has filled me with hope and optimism. I think the list proposed in this video is truly well-said, and every single one of us in this class should do their best to support all 20. We are privileged to live in a world with access to food, drinkable water and daily supplies; given that we can strive for a more climate-friendly lifestyle without having to compromise our current affluence, there is no excuse to adhere to planned obsolescence or consumer-first principles anymore. I feel like my peers have already contributed great points here, so instead of babbling further here, I will continue to lead a minimalist life by example and hopefully convince those around me to do the same. The real assessment for this course doesn't end at the final grade - it extends all the way through our lives!

I agree! I think this lecture especially makes me feel motivated and refreshed to continue to spread the word about ways to combat the climate crisis even when this course ends. Here's some of my responses to some of the things Ken mentioned:
<br><br>
1. educate boys and girls fairly > I am particularly passionate about this point because it is so so important to educated all of the future of tomorrow, not just one gender or one socioeconomic class!
<br><br>
2. practice minimalism > like you said, we are extremely privileged to be able to have the things we do, so if we can make steps towards really thinking about our belongings and decreasing them, it'll help the environment so much!
<br><br>
3. buy from companies with environmentally-sound and socially just practices > this is so important! support companies that support our Earth!
<br><br>
4. vote for candidates who advocate for climate policies & tell people about the climate crisis, explain the solutions and the importance of voting > need I say more?
<br><br>
This was a great lecture, not only for ENG 23 students but also those who stumble upon this video. Informative, to the point, a great way to finish this course as well!

I’m happy to see this list of all the things we need to do personally and as a society to address the climate crisis, as multiple times throughout this course I have found myself lost in the seemingly giant issue that is solving the climate crisis. Though I can’t help but feel that since the crisis is caused at a societal level, it really has to be solved that way as well, and therefore I really only feel that change in personal action is useful in the way that it is a catalyst for the change in society. I think this happens in two ways, one is that through taking action on the knowledge we have of the climate crisis means that it allows us to really “be the change” ourselves, lest the alternate scenario when we preach the facts like Al Gore, but get criticized because we are still doing our equivalent of flying around in private jets. The second important effect of personal action that I see is that it sends the message of the climate friendly lifestyle to those people around us, and really changes society more than words ever can.

I agree, this list is so simple to understand and it really makes me feel like, the more of these things I incorporate into my life, the lower my carbon footprint will be. All the decisions I make from here on out will be influenced by what I learned in this class. If I'm doing one or two of these things right now, I can work on one or two more, and reduce my footprint in a really manageable way. I'm currently practicing five of these methods without even trying, and I consider them meaningful parts of my life. Taking my bike around makes me feel more in tune with my community and more appreciative of nature. The more impact one feels like they have, the more they'll be motivated to keep the trend. This fight for our planet is gonna take mass movement and protest, but also mass connection and community.

I think this is a great video, probably Ken's best. It relatively short (he goes over 20 thinks in just over 24 minutes, 1 minute per item), but manages to capture the course in its entirety.  I also really like the split, as it differentiates the things we can individually do, and the things that need to be done for the society. In my opinion, the last one is the most important. Each one of us needs to do what we preach. Peter is a great example, so is Ken. Both of them are living the lives they preach and showing it can be done. We cannot give people who try to attack that climate change exists ant more leverage like, they don't practice what they preach. We cannot be hypocrites in this process, people will only shy away from the movement. We need to do our best to implement most if not all of what Ken has taught us. We are the ones who are going to have to cause the change, so lets start now.

I agree with you, we are the ones to make the change. It is all up to us to help mitigate the climate crisis. I also admire both Kevin and Peter for setting such a great example on how to live a life that helps reduce your carbon footprint. By the look of it they also look really happy with this type of lifestyle. They do not need these big luxuries possessions to maintain their happiness. I also admire them for changing their way of life for the next generation. This shows how much of a selfless person they are. Kevin and Peter are fighting for  future generations so they do not have to live with a climate crisis. What makes it selfless is that they are fighting for the next 50 years even though they might not be here. ( I know that sounds sad but that's what makes me admire them, they are doing it for us). I would not let their actions go to waste. That is why I am also helping to help mitigate the climate crisis for my future and the next generation. Also I plan to be happier by doing these things. I want to help our planet and I know once we eliminate the climate crisis I am going to be happy. I have faith that we will eliminate it.

I think this may be one of your greatest videos ken....it is great that you gave so many examples on how we can make our lives better and combat the climate crisis. All of these suggestions are good for the environment are just good in general to practice in everyday life. When it comes to "educate boys and girls fairly" it is plainly obvious that it should be something we should already be doing. One of the most important things I think we can do is vote for people who support climate policies to make the world a better place (bernie)! This list should be told to everyone and explained so they can understand how they can improve their lives. I hope that one day these simple changes will be common for every american and we do enough to combat the climate crisis.

Everyone needs to watch this video because Ken breaks down twenty different ways a person can help mitigate the Climate Crisis. Ideally, I think it would be great to do all of the different ways, but doing as many as one person can is better than none! Starting with personal actions in the beginning and moving towards collective/political action is important because beginning with our own lives will keep us motivated to fight in other ways as said by Ken in a previous video. It is interesting to see how both of these sets of solutions are interconnected because they all revolve around our culture. One’s culture is based on personal actions shared by it and the greater political and social ways is also an influence on it. I used to think it would be impossible to give up meat two years ago, but after taking ENGL 22, I was able to do it for all life on Earth. Today, I made the switch to veganism about a month ago and it’s been great and I am proud of myself for doing it. Everytime I feel like I can’t do it, I remind myself why I made this switch and look at the bigger picture I am trying to make. Saving our planet. It probably will not be easy for other people because of a variety of reasons and those people should not feel bad for not doing it right away. Small steps are just as important and can do a lot on their own.

“Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet” was a great summary of all the solutions that we have learned in this class this quarter. I like how Professor Hiltner separated the list into individual and collective actions. This makes it very easy for me to see what I can do as an individual first. Some things from the individual action list that I plan on working on right now are limiting my food waste, eating more like a climatarian, taking more public transportation, and buying a lot less. I really feel like consuming too many unnecessary goods is a big issue in my life and the lives of many Americans. But, cutting down on the things that you buy has so many benefits besides just environmental benefits. You can save money and also really appreciate the necessary things that you do have and not fall into the material goods hedonic treadmill. Thus, this is something that I would really like to spread to more people. Some things from the collective action list that I plan on doing are voting for candidates that advocate climate policies and joining environmental activist organizations. Voting is so important and is something that does not take very much effort and time. As Professor Hiltner said, if there is one thing that we can only do one thing, we should vote.

I also really liked how Ken split the list up as well. It also reminds me (and hopefully others) of how we need to take actions from different approaches as well. I also feel the need to eat more like a climatarian and waste less food. I already eat a plant based diet so I feel as though limiting my food waste is one of the best things I can do in the kitchen to help the planet. Buying less is hard but it does make you value the things you have more, you're right! And if you do ever need new clothes just make sure you're going to thrift stores of buying from good companies like Ken also mentioned in the video. Our money has power so we need to spend it correctly. And in order to do so we have to do our research and educate ourselves on the right companies to buy from. We need to spend time reading about what's going on with the climate too. We need to figure out what can be done and get a conversation going. I love that Ken puts an emphasis on talking to people about going to vote. Luckily here at UCSB a huge portion of people voted but it's definitely not like that in other places. We have to teach people that their vote matters and that they have to be voting for themselves and every other thing on this planet. Could you imagine what the world would be like if we all did these things? The amount of emissions saved and the increase of happiness would be phenomenal. By doing these things that Ken has provided we are taking steps towards a future that puts people first instead of corporations. We need to remember where our priorities are and make sure that our actions represent them. We truly must be the change that we want to see in the world. It starts with us.

This lecture was very inspiring and made me realize that it is very possible for me to make a change in my daily life. It’s not necessary for us all to completely change our lives, instead, if we make small, consistent changes, it is possible for us to make a very impactful change, despite not thinking that we are doing much. I think that the most important solution is either number 9 or 12. It is so important not to support the fast fashion industry- corporations like forever 21 and H&m. Instead, we can opt to go to thrift stores or consignment stores. This not only allows us to express our individuality, but it allows you to not contribute to the plague of fast fashion. The other most important tip, in my opinion, is to vote. Voting, although I’ve heard people argue against the worth of one vote, is absolutely integral to changing the things that need to be changed. Yes, we can create small groups of people who care about the climate, but the people who are really able to get things done are the people in power. If we choose to elect people that don’t have the climate’s best interest in mind, it can have negative effects on the climate.

-       Wrapping up this class it was nice to see a list of what we can do personally to have the biggest impact on saving the planet from the climate crisis. The list that we read previously on the “top 25 best things to reduce emissions” was good but I felt like a lot of the things included in that list were out of my touch to partake in. The list that ken gave us with examples was much easier to grasp and get behind. 
<br><br>
-       I think the first thing I will do in order to help the cause is switch over to a complete plant-based diet… nowadays with the big wave of veganism this should not be too hard to overcome. I also think it is extremely important to spread the word to my friends and family who have no idea what is happening due to the emissions of C02 caused by humans. I had no idea that it was such an alarming factor of everyday life right now and most people probably don’t.

As Ken notes, this is the best video of them all to recommend to a friend or family member to watch. It is exactly the type of summary kind of video that I would expect Ken to make to close out the course. It's informative and encompasses all of the big ideas that we’ve been talking about this quarter, and provides a nice and concise list of actual actions that anyone can consider taking to help combat the climate crisis. It was nice to hear the list of things and listen to what Ken has to say about every item on the list, and be able to think back on previous discussions and realize how much thinking and learning we have done in these past ten weeks. 
<br><br>


Personally, the listed actions that I find the most important and impactful are voting, equal education, practicing some form of minimalism, and maintaining an environmentally conscious diet. Although, thanks to this course, I now not only know all of the steps Ken listed in this video but also why those actions can have an effect on the climate. I won’t go into why I think each of those actions I mentioned are the most important, since we have discussed them all in-depth in previous discussions. 
<br><br>


I will say that for sure every single item on Ken’s list of 20 is great and they are all wonderful steps to take in mitigating the climate crisis. This class has really opened my eyes and educated me on the gigantic issue that is climate change. I would recommend this class to all of my peers, regardless of whether they are interested in it or not, because climate change is literally an existential threat to humanity and it warrants everybody getting involved and becoming informed about the problem. I’ll be happy to finish this class knowing that I really have learned something, and will be actively trying to adjust my lifestyle even in little ways so as to minimize my impact on the environment.

I definitely will recommend this video to any friends or family members who would like to know about climate change and what they can do to help. I think this video was my favorite lecture video because of its practicality and concision. I think it's important to know that the list of 20 things can be used by anyone. The great thing is that you don't have to do them all. Of course, it would be nice, but some people need to ease into change. I think everyone who loves the planet can look at the list and find at least one thing they feel passionate about and take action to make an impact.

Ken, you got me feelin’ like Babe Ruth right now! I guess it’s coming up to be my turn at bat, and I want to knock it out of the park. I want to hit the climate crisis so hard I knock it into Pluto and let the world heal from its previous trials and tribulations. People have been saying this sounded like a sports coach giving a pep rally, and I’m here to agree with that. Between your referencing of what I can do, what you can do, and what WE can do when we do it together, I feel good. Matter of fact, I feel great knowing that there are things for us to do that will alleviate the poor condition we have put the world into. 
<br><br>

I for one am coming out of this lecture vitalized in knowing that there are people who actively seek repair, and I am happy to say that after this class, I am one of them.

I thought that as a closing statement to a class full of information it was the perfect length. I really appreciate the format of this video, and how it was broken up into two parts of ten. It made the list easier to understand and remember. It also inspired me to use the lista s sort of a checklist. I typed it up and printed it to hang on my wall. While many of these points, such as eating plant-basedand, limiting food waste, and biking is immiediately attainable. I can adopt them into my daily practices with little to no effort. I voted on March 3rd and choose canidates I felt  would best support environmental issues. However other points will take me longer to fufill. For example joining other initiatives and equal education. Next quarter (if we return to campus) I am excited to look into green intitiatives like the people who came to talk to us mentioned. Eco-friendly buying will be slightly harder, but I am excited to live in a way that matches my morals. As many other people mentioned, I really appreciated the positive note this ends our lectures on. Going through this list for myself really inspires me to change the way I live. Even the title of Ken’s lecture was hopeful; “Pulling it all together: 20 things we each can do to save the planet”. We WILL save the planet. This class has given us the tools and information we need to put into practice what we now know will change our current trajectory. Anyone who leaves this class not ready has failed. Anyone who can ignore what we learned and not stick to this list has not learned at all. But I have faith that I willand thatis at least one personI can be sure of. Thank  you for a wonderful quarter.

The lecture video titled, Putting it all together: 20 things each of us can do to save the planet, does a great job at summarizing all the different topics we have discussed throughout the duration of the course so far. We have discussed the main contributors to climate change, the factors that go about warming the atmosphere to solutions we can implement into our daily life to minimize the amount of natural greenhouse gases we admit. In my opinion, the discussion about the possible solutions we as students can enact has been a large motivation and interest for many of us. At times it did become overwhelming the fact that large private institutions controlling the fossil fuel and agriculture industry were being supported and protected by the exact politicians we expected to hear our complaints about our environmental worries. However, when continuing further more down the line, we began to discuss Project Drawdown. In my opinion, this was the pivotal moment when we all realized that there are in fact changes we can implement into our lifestyle that can make a difference, even though it may be a small step, there is still value in taking the initiative towards the right direction. This gave us a sense of optimism about the future. Yet, personally, I am skeptical that we as a society will realize the need to make changes to our current lifestyle. Perhaps that is the reason why we, the youth, have to set the example and be environmental activists to better our society and save our home for ourselves and the generations that will come after us.

I completely agree with your response; I resonated with your statement that a main motivator for each of us as students is learning what we can do about the climate crisis, even when the change that needs to take place feels incredibly overwhelming.  I also agree with your assessment that unfortunately much of society does not realize what a profound issue we are facing which leaves the burden of change on the younger generations.  While this statement makes me feel fairly pessimistic, mainly because of the lack of power the younger generations currently have, it gives me hope that we can raise enough chaos for the generations with power to change current legislation.  Additionally, if the younger generations continue to grow while maintaining their passion for climate justice, eventually society will begin to shift.  But is there enough time to wait for humanity to naturally carry out its course?

<br><br>

Personally, I found this lecture a great recap of the course.  Although there was a lot of extremely pessimistic material presented throughout the course, I found this video to instead provide suggestions and solutions to how each individual can do their own little part in solving the climate crisis.  Throughout the course I have found that I have become increasingly conscious of my own carbon footprint and small changes I can make in my life to decrease it.  Living on campus at UCSB has both made it harder and easier to have a sustainable carbon footprint; although I do not have much control over what I eat and the use of a computer, I can bike almost everywhere and when not I can use the public transportation system.  Living this way makes me want to do more to reduce my carbon footprint even more.

In this week's lecture Ken talked about ten ways we can make a difference individually and ten ways to make a difference through political and collective action. I think this is a very useful lecture because it gives a great overview of all of the things we have been talking about and connects it back to the films and readings we have been working on. I don’t think that these two lists are very difficult to achieve. Many of the individual changes we could make are not radical. For example, buying less, living in cohousing, not buying too much food, and limiting our travel are all ways that we could individually reduce our emissions. For political and collective, Ken noted that if you can't do any of these changes the one thing you can do is vote. Voting for people who are going to make changes that you wish to see in the world is very doable. It takes less than 2 hours and year and you can even vote through mail if you know you can't get the time off work. Not one person can make these changes. We need to all work together to make individual, collective, and political action to shift our cultural habits that are destroying our planet.  
<br><br>
I agree with Ken that to rely more on technological innovation over making these individual or collective changes in dangerous and does not address the problem from the source. By relying on technology we take no personal responsibility in the matter. Most of us have contributed more emissions then we should and by relying on others to make new technology that are going to “fix” it we are not taking responsibility for the issues we have caused.

This week's lecture video, “20 things that each of us can do to save the planet,” was extremely informative to watch and is like a mini summary of what is expected to come out of English 23. I would definitely recommend this video to any of my friends or family members so that they can learn little more about the climate crisis and realize that we they help by making several simple changes. At first, I was quite dreading watch this 24-minute video, although while watching I began to grow more interest and did not feel like I was watching it out of force because I believe Ken constructed this video and very encouraging and inviting way that makes you want to help the world and take part in change because it is ultimately in our hand and we are all capable to making the greater change, hopefully resulting in a better world.
<br><br>

Change starts with just one person, when one person acts other people around them tend to follow. This is how we are going to be able to make greater impacts, if we each personally take action, it will then spread and influence change in others as well. I really believe in the phrase” Small action lead to big changes.”

I was also hesitant in watching a 24-minute video, but because it was so informative and entertaining, the time went by pretty fast. If there was any video from this class that I would recommend to someone I know, it would definitely be this one because there is so much to learn and gain. One of the personal actions that I felt applied to many of the people I know and I was example eight and ten: to buy less things both in-store and online. Last year during my first year away from home and with no one to regulate my spending habits, I would spend a lot. With the various discounts offered to college students, I would often spend my free time browsing online and quickly adding any cute top into my cart. But after taking this class, I have really reevaluated my shopping habits and unsubscribed from most promotional emails from stores in order to prevent any more temptation. I also plan on instead of blowing through my paycheck on unnecessary items, I should just save my money for one really nice thing that I know will last forever and be overall more sustainable. 
<br><br>
When it comes to collective action I can see how voting and through demonstrations, we can really make a difference, especially in our current climate here at UCSB. For Super Tuesday, it was mine and my mom’s first time voting for a presidential candidate in the primaries and although I was not there to be with her and my grandparents on election day, I had many talks with them over the past week about how Bernie was the best candidate for our working-class Latino interests, and also for the overall planet as he is a leader in initiating the Green New Deal. And with Bernie winning in California, it shows that although our one vote maybe individual, collectively we can make sweeping change. And in terms of the importance of collective action within our own campus, Ken’s example shows how important it is for everyone at UCSB from faculty to undergrads, that we support grad student’s in their fight for overall better living standards.


<br><hr>
I too would most definitely recommend this video to friends, family members, and pretty much anyone who wants to know more about what they can do to help mitigate our climate crisis. Even Ken himself says that if you were to watch only one of his videos, he would recommend this video. 
<br><br>
I agree that this video was a mini summary of the course; every solution we've learned throughout the past 9 weeks of taking this course was just summed up in a 24 min long video, making this lecture video an extremely useful and informative one to someone who has never taken this course or to even students of this course so they can be reminded of these possible solutions. I thought I was going to find this video dreading, like you found it during the beginning, but to my surprise I didn't. When Ken stated that a lot of the stuff he's going to mention might seem repetitive (that’s if you kept up with the class and do the readings), in my head I was like, “yeah I figured” and kinda rolled my eyes but just went on and felt obligated to still watch the video because it never hurts to implement the same information in your head, that way it sticks with you and you’re able to communicate the information with others. 
<br><br>
Your last statement regarding the phrase, “small action leads to big changes” has coincidentally stuck with me throughout this entire course. Whenever I feel as if I am not doing much action to help our crisis, I think of all the changes I've done, even if they are small. I think about how I tremendously changed my diet, how I ride my bike instead of a car to get to places, how I communicate with my friends about climate change in hopes they can take action too, how I voted yesterday, etc… all of these small changes do add up, and will eventually make a huge difference. I hope many others have this mentality too. Optimism over pessimism!

First off, kudos to you Ken, this video was put together very concise and straightforward. This is something I will definitely be sharing with family and friends when trying to help educate others. So thank you for nicely tieing this course together. This video entailed everything I expected it to, and honestly, I don't have much to say, like you mentioned it was a bit redundant for a student who has spent 9 weeks in your course. I appreciated the way you split the ways to take action as I found the collective way to be a bit more engaging. That's just because I feel like its the more impactful way. While yes individual changes will go some way it would be so much more beneficial if society as a whole was on board. When you discussed the political activism part I felt somewhat proud, because of this course for the primaries I felt very involved. Being a relatively new voter you don't know much about what your doing but this time around I felt like I knew what I was looking for in candidates, and I was proud to share why I voted for certain people with my family and the values I held. So thanks Ken!

After watching this lecture, I immediately felt the need to send this video to all my family members so that was exactly what I did. I was trying to put my thoughts into words to comment on the video, then I realized that I already put my thoughts into words in the email I sent my extended family. So here is the email. We can be the change by reaching our and informing others. 
 <br><br>

Hello Family Members! <br><br>

It is your favorite family member Karly who is very much in the throes of earning a bachelor’s degree at UC Santa Barbara in Biological Sciences. Anyway, I am currently taking a class about the climate crisis and what each of us can do about it. 
<br><br>
As part of the younger generation, this issue is very prevalent and important for my future, and if I ever will have children (honestly its not looking to promising with the direction that the climate crisis is moving in) it is very important for their future. We are reaching a point where we all need to take immediate action in-order to not continue to spiral into a place of further despair. We have reached a place where the CO2 in our atmosphere is causing and will continue to cause MAJOR problems; fires that are more destructive, flooding, drought, sea level rise, complete extinction of millions of animals, and so much more. 
<br><br>
I am not writing to try to scare all of you. I am writing because often the issue of climate change is turned into a political issue instead of what is actually taking place. The knowledge needs to be spread so that we can act on it. We need to elect the people and officials that are going to fight for the well-being of this planet. Unfortunately, this is hard because the people running that are running our country are in the older generation that won’t have to deal with the real consequences of the climate crisis. We need to vote thinking about all generations!
<br><br>
I attached the link to a video of my professor discussing how we can act to start to turn this issue and take steps towards a healthy planet and a healthy future. Ken Hiltner, is a professor in Environmental Humanities and developed the course I am taking so that anyone has access to the information, this includes readings, videos, and small lectures. The video I attached is pretty much a summary of the whole course however if you are interested in any one step in particular Ken has dedicated a whole section to the issue, and you can find more information on the website The Climate Crisis 101.
<br><br>
I am asking you guys to take 30 minuets out of your day sometime to watch this video, and if you have any questions please reach out to me! There are so many small steps that you can take that make a major change. Voting for the political leaders that sport the environment. Changing your diet in small ways. Taking steps towards living more of a minimalist lifestyle. Biking more. Taking about the issue. Through conversation I have even gotten my parents to stop using plastic produce bags, think about their waste, and switch to a more plant-based diet. 
<br><br>
I really appreciate you all taking the time to read this. Please let me know if you have any question or concerns because I would love to discuss it. I love you all dearly.
<br><br>
Knowledge is only power once acted upon. 
<br><br>
Change starts with us!

In this lecture of Ken, twenty solutions can effectively address the climate crisis being listed, and they can be divided into basically two main categories—personal actions and collective actions. For personal actions, the food-wasting stands out to me very much. According to the lecture, about a third of the global greenhouse gas emissions are due to food production, and almost half of them are because of the raising of livestock. There are about 40 percent of the land of America used for the mere purpose of feeding livestock, mainly cows. This is a huge number. Another suggestion that Ken mentioned in his lecture which I find very practical is switching to another diet rather than the traditional meat-based diet. According to the study, eating as a freegan is more effective than a vegan in the aspect of protecting the environment. However, having a “climatarian” style of eating, which has the diet in an environment-friendly way, can even contribute more in the area of stopping the pollutions. Adding together these two aspects, there will be a reduction in the greenhouse gas emission of 137 gigatons per year.
<br><br>

Although these personal solutions are doable and ought to be taken, it is not enough to even halt the climate crisis. The public should also pay attention to the collective actions, such as voting for candidates to support sweeping climate policies and so on. Among all of these suggestions, there are two that I interested in, which is the education of women and family planning. According to Ken’s lecture, the more educated the women are, the fewer children she will have. Also, there are about 85 million unintended pregnancies every year, and 45 percent of pregnancies in the United States are unintended. In Latin American and the Caribbean, women usually don’t have the option to choose when, whether to get pregnant or access to abortion. In my opinion, if these two aspects are successfully addressed by people, global greenhouse emissions can be dramatically reduced.
<br><br>

I believe that if everyone has the idea of protecting the environment in their mind, and practice this idea through their daily actions, the climate crisis can be successfully addressed, and living conditions of human can be improved a lot.

The week 9’s lecture video “Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet” is a summary of all the lecture videos together to review all the personal actions we can do. It is a really good video to spread the “green” idea to people surrounding us. First, each point is very clear listed. The audiences can digest contents easily. Second, it contains all the aspects, both individual and collective aspects in this 24-minutes video. I think it is a worth 24 mins for people. Among the twenty things, I really love the last suggestion: become the change you want to see in the world. Doing now is the most powerful and useful action for saving the planet. Perhaps there are a lot of problems we still cannot solve now. Yet, if we do not do anything, we will be regret in the future. “Do one’s best and leave the rest to God” is all we can do. Starting from ourselves, maybe just little, will be better than doing nothing and ignoring the worse situation.

I agree with you that this video is definitely worth the 24 minutes. This video summed up the main points made in our readings and throughout lectures. I really appreciate how the list incorporates both individual and collective action. Starting this class, I was a bit hopeless when it came to my thoughts on the climate crisis. I honestly thought we were doomed. Now, I can easily look at 20 things that would make a huge difference, and can feel some sense of hope for our planet’s future. I do disagree with your point that we can only do our best and leave the rest to god, because our best isn’t good enough and god sure doesn’t seem to be stopping mass consumerism and the unhealthy lifestyle we are choosing to live. Maybe I feel this way because I am not religious, but I do believe we can no longer just sit back and hope for the best. We need action and we need it now.


<br><hr>
As you mention this video overall sums up all the ideas and notions we can do as human to help the climate crisis and lessen our carbon footprint overall. All of the films, notions, and ways of living presented in this video pretty much wrap up and summarize all others, that is why as Ken mentions it does sound redundant to me because I have been keeping up with the material. It’s crazy to think there are so many little things we can each do that will help the environment in little steps, all it takes is everyone getting on this wave and taking their personal steps to change. With each little step made by individuals, the population will in result follow and the change will be significantly seen. This video is in fact the most important and significant video holding all 20 ways of change we can take. I think this is very simple and easy for one to take even a few of these very easy actions on. If we all can just pick three of these aspects we know we can change or follow, the world is bound to change the climate crisis bound to be fixed.

<br><hr>
I agree with you, it was a great recap of the course. I will definitely rewatch when i am studying. After taking English 22 last quarter, I felt hopeless because i learned so much about climate change, but not many solutions. Now after nine weeks of this course, this 24-minute video nicely lays out 20 solutions to help mitigate the climate crisis. Ken offers both individual and collective solutions. Before this course i felt hopeless that I couldn't do anything to help combat the climate crisis, but I can now look at a list of 20 things I can do to make a difference. In terms of personal changes, the only “big” change I’ve made is that I stopped eating meat. I don’t own a car, and overconsumption has never been a problem for me because I'm poor. This past election I made sure to vote, but I was disappointed to learn that not as many young people voted as four years ago. It’s important for people to learn these 20 solutions because it could have made a difference in the amount of younger voters this election.

This is a very fitting last lecture for this class. I was formerly very pessimistic toward the climate change and tried to turn a blind eye toward it. It's much easier to just talk about problems than act on them, after all, and yet even easier to treat the climate crisis as another dinner conversation topic. As a result of this, so much of the rhetoric surrounding the climate centers on what is wrong with the situation. While alarmist approaches are useful to an extent because it motivates people to act, I'm still surprised by the hopeful take of this lecture video. Out of all of the suggestions that Ken listed, I am most interested in the personal changes. It's still hard for me to be hopeful about the current administration and people in power who receive money from oil companies, however that certainly will not stop me from voting. Other, more politically inclined individuals would be better suited for seizing power. Focusing on doing as you say and effective communication are all crucial to the solution.

I like how the 20 solutions for us to fight the climate crisis are divided into personal actions and political actions. Many of the solutions such as eating a more plant based diet, biking instead of driving, practicing minimalism, and educating myself on the crisis itself are things that I have been doing and have become more aware of since taking this class. However, I need to consider that after learning about this comprehensive list, there are even more ways in which I can help the environment. One thing that I will now make sure to do is to research the companies that I purchase from ahead of time to make sure that they are implementing environmentally sound and socially just practices. In addition, I can join even larger groups that advocate for campaigns for the climate crisis so that my voice can be heard. Overall, I feel very inspired after watching this video and it motivates me to make sure others do as well. I hope that more people can become educated on the climate crisis and the steps that they can take to help this issue.

This lecture gave us various ways (twenty in particular) of how every one of us can make a change to the climate changes. The twenty things specified in the lecture video give different people different things to do that work for them. One of the particular actions that stood out to me is the act of voting. Last week’s film video also stated how voting is an important act of stating our opinion about the environment. Even though voting to put our ideas out there is very crucial. We have to put knowledge and thoughts into our votes instead of simply voting blindly.

I totally agree with what you said about people just showing up to the polls to vote blindly. That is what most Americans do. They understand that voting is a civic duty, but they ago into the booth and vote on things they have no knowledge about and run the risk of voting for things that will be detrimental to the environment. As I sit here writing this. I myself am still undecided on who I’m going to vote for tomorrow just for the simple fact that I want someone in office that is going to restore not only our sense of unity and humanity, but also someone who is going to put the planet first. Aside from the presidential nomination, local governments are just as important when casting votes because the change starts from the bottom and works its way up. If the change doesn’t start from the bottom, how will it ever create a bigger change on a larger platform? 
<br><br>
Although I agree with part of your response, I have to point out that the 20 solutions that Ken lays out are not things that people can pick and choose what they want to do and what is convenient to them. All 20 solutions should be employed by every single person on the planet in order to enact real change. The goal is to make all 20 changes and although that is extremely optimistic and unlikely to happen. we need to have that mindset anyways. We cant just brush some of them off because they don’t fit a certain lifestyle, we have to put ourselves in the position to make sure we strive to do all of these things because our planet should be worth a the fight for everyone.

I agree with what you said, especially about voting and how important it is that we exercise the right that those of us have to vote, and ensure that we put as much knowledge as possible into these votes. I’m really glad that the way the timing of this class worked this quarter, voting happened today, march 3rd, and I was able to further learn through this class how important it is that I make my vote, while also learning about how this vote can impact the climate crisis. Although I think all of the things Ken mentioned in this video are important to do, at the end of the day, there will be people who will refuse to make these changes if they aren’t being forced to. This is why voting is so important. As long as we have someone in power who is against improving the state of our planet, I really don’t believe we will see as significant of an amount of change that’s truly necessary. If it wasn’t for this class, I probably would have continued to be uneducated on the climate crisis and the ways we can improve the current state of our planet, which is why I feel there are an immense amount of people who are simply unaware of how serious of an issue climate change really is. If we are able to elect a president who is aware of this issue and ready to make the necessary changes, our futures and the futures of our children are much brighter.

Not to sound dramatic, but I feel like taking this course has really changed me as a person. I always knew our planet wasn’t doing so hot, but I did not understand the urgency of the climate crisis, nor have the passion to do something about it, until now. I find myself increasingly choosing vegetarian options not only when feeding myself, but whenever I am babysitting for my family in town. I also have been more inclined to eat and shop more responsibly. For me, this means I buy less food at a time so I have less food expiring at once, and I make sure to eat the food I buy before it expires, so I waste less. Since I have learned so much over this course, I also find myself increasingly talking about climate change during casual conversation. I feel like it is my responsibility to spread awareness to others and encourage them to enact change as well. This class has empowered me, and I believe my classmates feel the same way. For this reason, I think the best thing Ken can do for the climate crisis is keep teaching this course. Ken, I hope you know you are making a difference!

I agree with you that taking this course has also changed my life. I knew that our planet was suffering, but I didn’t know exactly what we had to do in order to help it. I didn’t know that some of the things we do so drastically affect the earth and emit enormous amounts of CO2 into the air. I think that this list sums up a lot of what we have learned in class and would help a lot of people better understand what we can do to save the planet. It doesn't take a lot to play your part, it can be trying to make more climate friendly choices at lunch or shopping sustainably. Even voting, which takes 1-2 hours a year, will help us put politicians that care about the climate crisis, into office.
	<br><br>

    I am constantly reminding myself that I shouldn’t be selfish as I go about my day. The decisions I make today will affect the generations to come. I have been trying to live my life keeping the climate crisis in mind. I don’t have to eat meat everyday, I don’t have to drive everywhere, and I don’t need to keep buying stuff that I don’t need. This class and list has also made me more informative about how to communicate with others when speaking about climate change. As someone in this class, it is my duty to inform others about what I’m learning. Not a lot of people get to take a class like this and I have to share what we can do to help save the earth. This list will be helpful for anyone who is interested to know how they can help and where to start.

I think this week's video on the 20 steps that each person can reduce carbon emissions and contribute to helping the climate crisis was a good capstone in the course. It provided a great summary of the course material over the past 9 weeks for the class specifically, and I think it also provides a great place for regular citizens to take action and help out with the climate crisis instead of reading and compiling multiple news sources that could potentially provide fake news. 
	<br><br>
I think it was great layout to split it into 10 personal lifestyle actions that people can do change and then 10 political actions that we can undertake to contribute to the community. Like Ken said, political action, when votes are added together and change is enacted, have more impact than the personal changes that one can make. Our elected representatives actually hold a lot of power in bringing about change and improvements for the climate crisis, and we need to take advantage of our ability to vote. We need to vote for candidates that are climate-conscious and focused on climate policy. 
	<br><br>
All in all, to help our planet and ourselves, we need to be conscious and start on these 20 steps that we can do to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.

In this week's video, Ken summarizes 20 personal ways to save the planet. This video provides a summary of the current environmental problems we face, and each of the 20 things listed in the video is easy and easy to accomplish in our lives. There are 20 things we can all do in our lives that easily benefit our environment and make our lives more meaningful. But I think you are right. Personal action cannot save the planet immediately or entirely, but government actions can react efficiently. Just like what you said that our elected representatives actually hold a lot of power in bringing about change and improvements for the climate crisis. Active political participation in the vote is on the list of politicians who can play an important role in reducing carbon emissions and saving our environment by advocating for laws and policies aimed at addressing climate change. As a young generation, we have learned this environmental knowledge and have more awareness of these environmental problems, we should act more. Of course, we can also recommend videos to family members, friends, and even strangers, so that they can take action to protect the environment. Finally, I hope our earth is getting better and better, and environmental problems can get more attention.

This video provides a short summary of all the important things we need to know going forward with the climate crisis, and how we can help as an individual. I think the content of this video is very important because it’s a relatively short video about a pressing issue which is something you can easily show family and friends in order to convey to them all the ways they can contribute to limiting the climate crisis. I believe a summary of all the things an individual can do to contribute to a cause (such as the climate) is essential because it’s a way to provide the mass of information in a digestible way. All of the ideas pertaining to the climate crisis can be overwhelming, so having a list of 20 things to follow is a manageable way to absorb the content. The importance of voting is very evident in this video and the many ways it can help with the issue of the climate is staggering. Knowing the effects voting can have on our climate, however, is why I will make it a priority of mine to always register and vote accordingly. I will be using the ideas on this video in my everyday life and I'm thankful for this class for teaching me all the pressing issues impacting us today and how I personally can help in order to save our planet.

I don't think I know any climate deniers in real life, but although the people in my life do believe in the climate crisis, the majority of them don't know the exact actions to take to prevent climate change and reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, I agree with you on how important the content of this video is. By making such a condensed yet simple video, Ken informs the audience exactly what to do instead of flooding the video with statistics and complicated facts. Sometimes people just need a set of straightforward instructions, especially for a pressing issue like climate change.


<br><hr>
I like how you used the word “digestible” to describe this lecture video. The small steps that we can take to mitigate the climate crisis were easily defined without an excessive use of scientific gibberish, which I think is one of the most important parts of reaching and capturing the attention of a large audience. I also agree with you on how a summary is in fact useful because there is absolutely no way people (who aren’t enrolled in this class of course) would scroll through and read/watch all of our assigned readings, lecture videos, and films, during their free time. This was a perfect conclusion to this course; I’ve definitely learned a lot about how my personal day-to-day activities as well as how society’s actions contribute to our growing climate footprint.
<br><hr>
I agree that while this video lecture was longer than other have been in the past, it felt relatively short in terms of the vast number of topics Ken was able to cover in just 24 minutes. I feel like since the beginning of the quarter, us students have been continuously asking Ken for a set list of things we can do to make actual change, and finally, we have been given this list of 20 things that not only we can do, but that we can share with people when the topic of climate change comes up, and they ask "well, what can we actually do". I also agree that this list of 20 things seems extremely manageable, and while it may be nearly impossible for some to make all these changes at once, it seems fairly practical to start by making one small change per week, just like Peter Kalmus and his family did, which resulted in him ultimately reducing his carbon footprint to 1/10th its original size. I too, have recently made a conscious effort to make sure I am registered and ready to vote when the time comes, and I feel that this portion of the lecture was extremely prevalent today, March 3, as it was Super Tuesday, as well as the first time I have ever voted since becoming old enough to do so. I too believe that I will be using the ideas present in this video in my everyday life, and I am eager to share it with friends and family members who are willing to make changes to their lives, and want to learn more about what exactly they can do to reduce their carbon emissions.

<br><hr>
I agree, by keeping this video concise, Ken maximizes the value of its content. Every minute contains important information on how we can save the planet. I appreciated the format of this video as well, and how he provided facts and compared statistics alongside his list of actions.  It gives us a very clear path of what to do and allows us many options and alternatives so we can personalize our contributions in accordance with our individual lives and circumstances. I will be passing this video along to my friends and family as I think it is very important, like Ken stated, to be informed and to help inform others so that action can be taken on a larger scale. Regardless of their climate change beliefs I know my family has much to gain from changing their lifestyles in more environmentally friendly ways. We all can be tremendously happier and healthier by following the top steps of Ken's list and there really is no reason for us not to at least try a few of these changes. I personally, am currently a vegetarian and taking steps to transition into a largely plant based diet- first by cutting dairy and animal products out of my diet which is muchhh harder than I thought. However, even from this small change I am noticing that my body feels better and healthier in general. I am sleeping better, my skin is clearer, and I have more energy. My point is, there is a lot to gain personally in taking steps to help the environment. Like Ken said, a win win!

	<br><br>

I like how you commented on the format Ken included. I agree that including both facts and compared statistics provides a stronger argument for why you should include these 20 things into your everyday life. I admire your passion, and I also will send this video to my friends and family. Being a vegetarian is such an important lifestyle change due to all the positive effects it has on not only your body but our environment. I have also been trying to make the transition but I agree it is hard to make lifestyle changes. These changes, however, are what will be the change we need in this fight with the climate crisis. Im happy to hear all the positive effects vegetarianism is having on you and wish you the best!

I’m so glad Ken made this recap style video on the climate crisis and all the solutions which are available and practical. If you think about it, everyone can do a few of these solutions from the list. More than likely no one will be doing all of them but if we all could just do a few of these in our life then we’d make a huge impact on our emissions. I personally would have a hard time with transportation because I’m constantly needing to take unscheduled trips but I’d have no problem changing my diet or not having a big house in order to have an impact. Maybe someone can’t sacrifice a diet but can sacrifice transportation then this person would still be helping the planet in another way!

This video was a great culmination of the course, highlighting the most important part of the climate crisis; things we can all do to mediate it. It made me hopeful because these are all things that we can incorporate into our lives and truly has made me reflect on how I live my life. Throughout learning about all of these I have incorporated them into my lifestyle. I have been trying to adopt a climatarian diet or at least being more aware of what I eat. I substitute turkey burgers instead of beef burgers in the dining hall. My lifestyle here, along with every other UCSB’s student, is much more sustainable and closely aligned with these suggestions than the average Americans. We share small housing with multiple roommates, bike/bus/walk to school, get goods and services through Free and For Sale, have multiple recycling and composting outlets throughout Isla Vista and on campus. I love the lifestyle here; being able to bike or walk everywhere, swapping clothes at thrifting events, living with friends. It does make for a happy lifestyle and being surrounded by nature at the beach, reminding us of its importance to keep it clean with beach clean ups. I like how Ken brought up the intersection of social justice and the environment especially concerning the importance of family planning and education of women. Population is no doubt a factor of climate change and we need institutional change to stop it. Family planning and contraception has to be promoted and available as well as the education of women. Unfortunately like the climate crisis as a whole, the US does not lead in this issue as it does not even promote family planning or contraception domestically let alone internationally. The US needs to change and it has to come from a bottom up approach since we can’t rely on the people at the top to make change as that's what we’ve been waiting for and nothing has changed. Voting is so incredibly important. We need to focus on mobilizing people and having Americans actually care about civic duty. I know people my age who didn’t vote in the most recent election because they were too “lazy”, “didn’t feel like it” or didn’t care enough. It was genuinely infuriating to hear that but that is the culture of America. Americans are not engaged or educated on civics at all or much about anything. We have extremely low voter turnout compared to other countries and that needs to change. The influence of lobbying and corporate interests are too undeniably involved with American politics so any change has to come from us and our votes. Education and voting is so incredibly important and central to any change that is going to happen in the US.

I also liked this video as a good wrap up of this course as a whole. This course also made me reevaluate my daily actions and how they are likely harming the planet and increasing my carbon emissions. I like that you pointed out living at UCSB helps students live a more sustainable lifestyle by living with roommates in smaller homes or apartments and we all pretty much bike or walk everywhere we go on a daily basis. I usually forget how big of an impact family planning can have on the climate crisis. It makes sense though, if there are more people, there are more resources used that contribute towards carbon emissions. It is crucial that contraception and available and affordable healthcare are present in our society to allow for this change to be made. I am a firm believer that voting is the most important part of creating a change for the betterment of the planet. People might think "oh my one vote will not make any difference" but if so many people are in that mindset thousands of votes will be missed and that could very well be the difference in an election. Voting power is one of our main rights in America and it means the difference between having someone like Trump in office who outright denies climate change and is an idiot, vs a lot of the other candidates who at least believe in the problem and are willing or excited and dedicated to fix it. Education and voting, like you said, are of the utmost importance.

<br><hr>
I really enjoyed reading your comment as I felt that I held similar sentiments to you in the scheme of the lecture and the climate crisis course in general. I completely agree with what you had to say about the sustainability of UCSB campus. I think it’s so incredible how environmentally progressive our campus is and how environmentally friendly our student lifestyles are. As you stated, almost no one drives around campus, there are countless second hand options, people live in community housing, and most people share an ideal of caring for the environment. While I do feel that our community does a great job of engaging climate activism in more ways than one, I find that there is a lot of ambivalence towards voting. In regards to what you mentioned about Americans falling short in the polling booths, I feel that this is entirely credited to privilege. Our country has extremely high levels of wealth per capita and because of this, there is immense privilege. For a lot of Americans, they have the liberty to say that they “don’t care about politics” or that they maybe engage in it as a hobby. For a majority of people, they don’t have this freedom as politics determines their life. It is necessary that all Americans vote for the sake of those that have to.

<br><hr>
I agree with you about how sustainable our life here at UCSB can be. This was one of my favorite lectures because it summed up the entire course and clearly outlined exactly what we need to do to help the environment. The list also gives us no excuse to act as if we did not know certain actions like flying had a severe impact on our carbon footprint. It shows us the impact we can have individually and through collective action like voting. Before coming into this course, I saw fossil fuel industries as the source of all these climate problems without considering how my actions have a significant influence. 
	<br><br>

This summary shows how some of the most important things we can do to make an impact are at an individual level with things like family planning, eating a plant-based diet and our method of travel. Reading through this list eases my worry about my contribution to the issue because I know I am already implementing some of the things or will in the future. For example, here at UCSB, I bike to work and class every day which helps with my daily traveling reducing my carbon footprint. Like many students here, I live in an apartment with several other housemates which also limits the amount of stuff I buy throughout the year because space is limited. After watching Cowspiracy and learning of the true impacts of animal agriculture, I have stopped buying meat during my grocery trips and am slowly decreasing my consumption of meat. When making some of my meals like lasagna, I found recipes where I could substitute meat and instead add zucchini and other vegetables. It was honestly a good recipe and I look forward to utilizing this approach with my other recipes that involve meat.

I found this video to be a great culmination and summarization of the main takeaways for this course because ultimately, arguably the most important thing to learn from this course is what you can and should do to address the climate crisis. My favorite statement that Ken made in this video was about how choosing what to buy is akin to voting with your dollars. In other words, it’s important to carefully choose what we spend our money on because consumerism has an impact on the climate crisis. This is connected to the idea of avoiding wasting food and perhaps starting to veer towards minimalism. 

	<br><br>

I also liked how the approaches to mitigating the climate crisis mentioned in this video were a combination of personal actions and creating change through activism. (However, it’s also important to note that often change on individual levels is what eventually leads to change on a broader scale.) For instance, female empowerment so that every woman has the right to access contraception and education is something I’m completely on board with. Once again, I really appreciate how Ken took the time to state that this issue is not the fault of the women but rather the social and cultural oppression they are subjected to. 

	<br><br>

I also really liked how communicating information about the climate crisis to those around us is mentioned as one of the twenty things each of us can do to help save the planet. This swings back around to the idea of misinformation, misconceptions, and bias surrounding the climate crisis that we began the course with. All in all, a great video to cap off what we discussed in this class.

I also found it important to recognize the importance of considering what you are purchasing with your money, which goes to the same in considering where the food that you are putting in your mouth came from. It’s that precedent of being aware of the sources that we use or take advantage of that is important in setting us apart to be better climate activists. Another thing similar to this is how Peter Kalmus said his family thinks of purchasing as each item adding 0.5 of CO2 equivalent to their carbon footprint, which will obviously add up with however more you buy. By considering how the company manufactures their items, whether it was done through an environmentally friendly and responsible process, we put our support into a secure method that doesn’t add on to the overwhelming contribution of CO2 equivalent gases. The same goes for our diet as eating a plant-based diet avoids supporting the meat industry and by making such changes in our lives, we outwardly express our principles that peers, family, and friends will notice.
	<br><br>

This is where communication is vital as we must share it with others rather than keeping the knowledge to ourselves. As mentioned before “Knowledge is power acted upon” and I believe it is knowledge that must be shared to others because with only a minority knowing and possibly acting upon it, the changes would be small rather than a growing, majority that is equally aware of the needed transitions we need to make as a society and nation in order for all people of the world to recognize what is happening to our planet.

I think this is the most beneficial lecture we have had. It got right to the point of what we need to do and Madde it seem very possible. I think all the points were important, but the one that is biggest to me was the last. You must be the change you want to see in the world. If you just keep hoping for something but never take action, it will never happen. Another important one is voting! The Green New Deal would make such a big impact on the collective part of the climate issue and it is important to keep that in mind when choosing the right candidate (Bernie). Finally my 3rd favorite point is minimalism! This is honestly one of the simplest changes I can make because I realize how much stuff I have that I do not need. Not only will I be saving the planet if I stop making unnecessary purchases, I will be saving money, too. All three points I mentioned come from a different sort of action, which shows we will need everyone to help and practice teaching deniers that this is the truth and facts.

I really enjoyed this lecture video because it was a great way of summarizing the entire course. It really showed us how we can still continue to make a personal positive impact on the environment after this course is over. Overall this video has kind of centered attention towards reducing individual carbon footprint without really forcing people to change their lifestyle drastically. Some solutions that I find really important are the ones regarding voting. I personally know people who choose not to vote simply because they believe that their vote doesn’t really make an impact. I kind of related it to this course in a way because throughout the entirety of this course, Ken has put strong emphasis as to how we can reduce our carbon footprint. Although the solutions may not reduce a significant amount at first, when you add up the total carbon emissions reduced with simple solutions, it adds up. In a sense, a little does go a long way. Although they may think that their vote doesn’t matter, what they fail to understand is that they aren’t the only ones voting on issues that they find important. There is power in numbers and when it comes to issues regarding climate change and how it impacts us socially, economically, and etc, everyone should step up and do what they can in order to make a difference. Another one that I also find important is rethinking about our actions and why it is important to maintain the environment. Like how Ken said it, we are essentially saving this earth for us, for all lives on earth, and for future generations.

I agree that seeing this video and the list of all of these solutions does make the climate crisis seem solvable and a problem that we can overtake and address if we are serious about taking action. I think that all of the individual solutions are extremely doable and everyone can at least take a few of the solutions that are listed in the section and apply it to their own lives. Specifically, I think that becoming a climatarian as well as being less wasteful with one’s food is an extremely simple way to help the environment at relatively low cost to one’s life. In addition, transportation is another aspect of life that could be transformed and healthy habits such as walking, biking, and using public transportation could foster a lifetime of decisions that benefit the climate. Especially as young adults and students, if we were to not view cars as an option for transportation unless used for carpool I think that we could get used to and normalize walking, biking, and using public transportation as an integral way of reducing our own climate footprint. As for the second list that addresses collective action I think that the common theme throughout the list and by far the most important one is to vote. As Ken said, it only takes an hour or two a year and even less if you are a college student and your polling station is down the hall from where you live. In my mind there is no excuse to not vote on behalf of the planet and on behalf of those who cannot vote as it is purely selfish to not be willing to give up an hour of your time every year to try and help address the issues that matter to society, especially climate change. With that being said if one has more time and feels strongly about an issue, I think that as Ken mentioned, activism is extremely important as it encompasses many of the items on this list such as protesting, joining initiatives, and talking to community members. Personally, I believe talking with the people around you is the most important out of these options because it is with the people who you are closest with that you can have the biggest impact on. If your friend or family member wants to know more or understand why voting is so important than I think that informing them in a helpful and practical way can be even more important than you voting yourself as you are spreading a message and a logic that can continue to be passed along and acted on weather through voting, individual actions, or activism.

If there was any of the lecture videos that were deemed to be the most important, I would think it to be this one. This lecture video gives people numerous ideas for helping the climate crisis. Not only do we need to start accepting that climate change is real and is a threat to the world as we know it, but we also need to start taking actions and putting an end to this climate crisis. It is important to note that ⅓ of global greenhouse gas emissions are due to food productions and about 15% of global emissions are due to livestock, mainly cows. Taking this into consideration, one solution we can all start implementing into our lives today is to buy enough food to eat and no more than that at markets and restaurants. A part of this solution may also include switching to a plant based diet, but it is not absolutely a necessity for change. Therefore a solution would be to be vegan and freegan, meaning eating a plant based diet, while also making sure that we reduce our food waste. When combing a plant based diet and freeganism into your life, you are reducing about 137 gigatons of CO2 or equivalent gases every year. To be honest, I had never of the term freegan before taking this class, but now when trying to encourage people to help the planet in regards to food I can appeal to the meat lovers that they do not have to give up their meat to help the planet as long as the food they buy is not wasted and is locally grown/provided. For instance, someone in North America can be vegan, but still heavily contributing to their climate footprint if they get asparagus in the winter. You see, asparagus does not grow in North America during the winter, instead it grows in South America. Thus when consumers in North America demand asparagus during the winter, the vegetable is flown from South to North America. As we already know, air travel can be extremely destructive to our planet.
    	<br><br>
Another solution would involve slowing down the rapid rate of population growth. In order to do this we can either start in the bedroom or in the classroom. It is important to realize that despite the American Dream of 2.5 children or what not, not everyone wants kids, or some may just want one. An astonishing 85 million unintended pregnancies occur every year and 32 million of them, that’s 38%, result in births. It is important to note that abortion is not legalized everywhere, nor do all women with unintended pregnancies who wish to not bear the child have access to a safe clinic that can do the procedure. Essentially, there may be less than 32 million of these unintended pregancies that lead to births if these women had access to safe and afforable clinics that offer abortion procedures. For instance, in Latin America and the Carribean, 97% of women don’t have unrestricted access to abortion as an option of last resort. Most people have this stereotype stuck in their head that only the people in the developing countries have unintended pregnancies, however this stereotype is false. We must realize that 45% of pregnancies in the US are unintended. The truth of the matter is, no matter if a woman is in a developing or developed country, she still may not have access and actually use birth control. It is important to remember that unintended pregnancies are not the sole responsibility of the women. Hello, there are condoms for a reason. The responsibility lies on both parties involved. However, I would take this a step further and even say that some of the responsibility even lies on the education system. We need to fairly and equally educate boys and girls, because the truth of the matter is we are not educating our girls enough. We are barely giving these girls an education, yet expecting them to have extensive amounts of knowledge. Statistics have spoken, when girls are more educated, the population growth rate goes down. Personally, I think the population growth is a lack of access and education problem that needs to be solved.
	<br><br>
    There are many more solutions mentioned in the video that address topics such as air travel, cars, moving to a city, housing, micro apartment, co housing, the amount of stuff we buy and own, but there is one that I especially want to draw attention to considering we just got done with the the CA primary presidential elections and later this year there will be the chance for a new president to be appointed into office. VOTING. If you are eligible, please register to vote, make your voice and concerns heard. Some may think their voice doesn’t matter, but it does, you must also remember there are local elections held as well, meaning if there is something more specific you want to see change about in your daily life, you have the right to vote for a candidate that you think would be best to solve this issue. If we want to stop destructive things to our planet such as fracking, we must vote because in fracking unfortunately is something that cannot be stopped on a personal level, it requires collectivism. Vote for candidates you believe will be best suited to help our planet, a candidate that is insisting on climate policies such as carbon pricing and the Green New Deal. Talk to your friends, your family, your classmates, or just anyone that is willing to listen about why voting is important. Who knows, maybe you’ll convince a fellow civilian to take action and go to the voting polls come election day. Make your concerns heard, and put your actions where your mouth is.

As I watched this lecture, I wrote down each of the 20 solutions Ken listed. As he went through each one, I thought about how I could apply it to my life. Many of the solutions I have already implemented into my daily life, and I am now looking into how I can incorporate the few others I haven't yet. Seeing all 20 of these solutions written out so clearly made me realize how plausible it is to bring them into ones' life. All of the solutions are fairly simple, and could easily be weaved into ones' daily life over a small period of time. I have decided that I am going to print this list out for myself, friends, and family. I want to spread this information, and debunk the idea that changing your life to better the climate is a difficult thing to do. Even just doing 5 of the items from this list can have a major impact on minimizing your carbon footprint. Hearing all of these listed out made me incredibly exciting for my life next year, as I am going to be living with a group of people who are just as eco- conscious as I am. We are already laying out plans for a garden in our backyard, complete with a compost bin and all. We all plan to have weekly group dinners, utilizing vegan foods and vegetables from our garden. I feel confident that I can truly start to make a serious difference in my life and how I personally effect the climate. This class has equipped me with the knowledge I need to become a strong, confident climate advocate, and for that I am eternally grateful.  
	<br><br>

In light of elections and voting, there is a quote I found that truly sums up the voting aspects on this 20 solution list: 
	<br><br>
"VOTE AS IF:  your skin is not white. your parents need medical care. your friend is a missing indigenous woman. your spouse is an immigrant. your land is on fire. your child is transgender. your house is flooded. your sister is a victim gun violence. your brother is gay. your water is unsafe. your best friend is disabled. your daughter is a sexual assault survivor." 
	<br><br>

I hope those that read this keep It with them the next time they are at the polls. I know it's how I vote, and hope it can be how you vote too.

I appreciate that you made a conscious effort to make this lecture video applicable to your life. It is extremely important to do so. There are so many ways to reduce our individual carbon footprints and ways to engage in collective climate action, so it is helpful to have a list to keep you on track. Like you said, even just doing 5 of the listed actions can have a major impact on your footprint. I certainly encourage every individual to implement as many of these changes as they reasonably can. However, I think it is significantly more important to engage in collective political action. Especially considering that a lot of these individual lifestyle changes require a degree of privilege; it’s much easier to be a vegan, and a smart consumer if you have a lot of money. We can extrapolate this idea to the global scale as well. It is much easier for the developed world to implement green technologies and eco-friendly policies than it is for the developing world. If developed nations were to only focus on themselves and ignore the needs of the developing world, we will get nowhere in this fight against climate change, and we will be perpetuating the systemic injustices that put us here in the first place. At the individual level, if we only about our own, personal footprints and do not engage in politics and collective action, we are participating in privileged negligence. This is a collective effort against a collective problem.
	<br><br>

Also, I love the quote you included about voting. It is crucial that we envision ourselves as part of a global community. It is crucial that we consider the disadvantages and disproportionate effects felt by marginalized communities. And as peoples from a privileged standpoint, we must be allies to all those who are systematically excluded from the benefits of global capitalism.

I very much appreciate that Ken's last lecture video summed up the most important things to do to combat climate change. The fact that previous generations have failed to dramatically live more sustainable lives that have led to the earth's current state is one that is scary to think about, and I think it is only fitting that Ken designed the course so that most of the depressing issues regarding climate were addressed at the beginning of the quarter so we would be left with a positive outlook at the end. Hearing about 20 things that I can do to save the planet in one sitting made me the most excited I've ever been about fighting climate change. I am looking forward to adopting many of the concepts Ken presents in the video for the Earth's sake, but I am also ecstatic to see how my mental and physical well being will benefit from making these changes.  I think that's the key to getting more people on board with fighting climate change: to offer these 20 things as ways that benefit people personally, separate of the positive effect on the environment.
	<br><br>


As cheesy as it sounds I'm very thankful that this class is offered at UCSB, let alone that a great professor like Ken teaches it. I can't imagine how much different most students would think about the environment if we hadn't taken this course.  I've gained perspectives from so many different people on so many different topics regarding the climate crisis that I otherwise would have likely not learned. I hope that I speak for most people in this class that more people need to be as informed as Ken made us during this quarter about the climate crisis. I cannot imagine a better way to have received and retained information about the climate crisis than through this course. I'm no Peter Kalmus in terms of my knowledge about the climate or my dedication to lowering my carbon emissions, but I'm grateful that I have been given important tools to live a sustainable life while being happy.

I feel the same exact way as you. As the quarter has progressed, I also recognized how Ken structured this class. The first few weeks seemed all doom and gloom, but the recent lectures, readings, and movies have seemed both to be more helpful and inspiring. I believe it ultimately culminated with this video, a comprehensive guide we can follow while we attempt to fix our planet. After listening to all the different solutions and contemplating their effectiveness, I ultimately decided that voting seems to be the most impactful one we can have. I was listening to a recent podcast and the guest made a great point. He said that politicians do not necessarily enact action based on what they believe, but rather what the people they represent believe. Thus, if we can show countrywide that we are concerned about the climate change issue and demand that it is addressed by our leaders, they will follow suit and begin to make the necessary changes. I am grateful as well for this class. While I came into it simply needed a GE credit, I have actually learned a lot and been introduced to new ideas that have made me question my lifestyle and motives. Hopefully this class can be continued in the coming years and can continue to make an impact on our youth.


<br><hr>
What we learned in this class should be common knowledge but unfortunately isn't. I just hope people actually implement what we learned into their lives. If I'm being honest, i think most people won't change their lives because it would decrease their comfort level or make them seem weird amongst their friends. People aren't gonna change unless the system changes or the shit hits the fan, and by that time it will be too late. I guess the only thing we can do is to tell people what we have learned, it is up to them what they want to do with the information. Another thing would be to tell people about Ken's website, as it is open to the public.

</span></div><hr>


<p>

As much as I appreciate the structured list of things we must do to combat the climate crisis, I do not think that these solution are feasible and will allow us to solve the climate crisis. 
	<br><br>

I personally would do all those things, in fact I'm doing most of them right now. However, I do not believe that every American will be willing to give up their life of luxury for something they don't even believe in. Even if we could create massive cultural stigma against activities that emitted carbon, that would take too long. By the time we do that it will be too late. The climate crisis will have taken its toll; there will be no going back. 
	<br><br>

I apologize for sounding like a pessimist, if anyone wants to see the end to the climate crisis, it's me. However, I am acknowledging that this is a fight against people much stronger than us. The oil companies are well equipped with millions of dollars invested in denial efforts. I'm not saying that the world will be in denial forever, but it will be for long enough; that's all they need.
	<br><br>

The fight against the climate crisis will only work if we have a massive cultural shift right NOW. We cannot afford to wait. Every second we wait, the permafrost melts more, the ice caps melt down, and the amount of greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere increase. I do no believe we have the capabilities of making such a large change in a short amount of time. This is the 6th extinction.

Please world, prove me wrong.

I've felt the exact same way about climate change this entire quarter. Even Leonardo DiCaprio, who was a major part of the first movie that we were assigned and a huge celebrity in support of climate action, ends up probably expending the most energy while living his life. His house is massive, and the majority of celebrities who can afford to live luxuriously AND sustainably choose the latter over the former more often than not, and much less do they think about doing them together. If these larger than life figures can't afford to expend energy living a sustainable life, I sometimes wonder how people like you and me can say that we're making a change. I appreciated going through this course and understanding how dire the consequences of our actions could be if we don't enforce change here and now, however I find it so difficult to believe that action will be taken before it's too late. I know that voting is important, as Ken highlighted in the majority of the second half of this lecture, but I also feel as though it's almost futile unless Democrats and Republicans push past their differences and join together on this issue. While I disclose that I did vote for Bernie during this election, I know that he didn't perform as well as Joe Biden did when it came to the primaries and sometimes it feels as though our voices are being drowned out by the boomers. I know that they've grown up with certain ideals, but in all honesty, ten to fifteen years down the line, I might have to worry about the air quality of a particular day before sending my children on their walk or bike ride to school. I might have to worry about my parents going on a walk outside because who knows if the slightly acidic rain might hurt them in a detrimental manner. I don't think that boomers deserve to have a say about climate change at times because the facts are undeniable, and while I have started incorporating freeganism into my diet more and more day by day, I cannot even begin to imagine how me making a change is going to change Alabama's opinion on climate change or any other Republican state for that matter.

I think Ken did a really good job at listing the 20 things we can do to reduce emissions. Some of them may not be convenient but none of them are something that is extremely hard to do. These changes are necessary to keep our world healthy for our future generations. The inconvenience is worth it to help improve our Earth. I feel like many of the political reasons were very similar but they still got the message out. It’s important that we get out there and vote for people who will make a change because nothing will get done if we have climate change deniers running the show. Voting will definitely be one of the most important ways to actually make sure change happens. I’m hoping climate change activism will become something that more people get behind because with the way the US is running now, if we don’t get enough people to vote for a different leader, we could end up losing our home planet.

This lecture video was a great culmination of what we had learned in this class. Ken has done a great job of making students and future climate activists aware of the fact that there are both personal and cultural changes that need to be made, and also larger political actions that need to be made. I agree that education is a major aspect of mitigating the climate crisis. Much of how I view my lifestyle through the lens of climate consciousness has been formed and influenced by a lot of what I learned in this class, especially in realizing that making changes like quitting red meat or practicing minimalism have an impact. I formerly had a pessimism towards the crisis, but now I am very aware of the fact that simply focusing on your own practices while also not being afraid to share it with others is a part of the solution. We can also communicate through our actions rather than words. Knowledge is nothing without action.

Yes yes this course this great and Professor Hiltner does try his best to inject a little bit of hope in this dismal situation.
	<br><br>
But being pessimistic is totally justified. I mean, ok, sure, if half of this class changes their lives drastically then yes there will be a positive impact. But we are a tiny percentage of the population. It would take 100,000 Eng 23 around the world for us to have a chance as a species. China and India will not stop burning coal. The average American will not stop driving big cars. 
	<br><br>

This class is great and much needed but it is too little too late. I'm baffled that education has not pushed this type of alarming (and rightfully so) course into the common core. I mean we need to do tons of shit to go to college but knowing about the climate crisis isn't a requirement? Press F for humanity


<br><hr>
I agree with you! The 20 solutions mentioned in the video were a great way to sum up everything we talked about in the course. I liked the second half of the solutions which involved taking political action. It's important to spread the word to friends to encourage them to vote. We need to not only think about ourselves but the lives of future generations. If we have the power to change and prevent something, why not take action and prevent others from suffering. I also liked that you pointed out that this class had you reflect on your own lifestyle. I also find myself comparing my habits to what we learn about and think of ways on how I can change for the better. I have given slow travel a thought and think it will be better, in the long run, to make the switch to using trains and busses when traveling rather than flying. It might seem a bit inconvenient but knowing the difference it can make, makes it worth it. This course has definitely helped reflect my lifestyle and has inspired me to make some switches to help reduce my carbon footprint.

This video was not only a final review but a good way for all of us to make sure that we are doing our best for the climate.  I think is video does a great job condensing the information we have been learning throughout his entire quarter into 24 minutes.  This was definitely helpful to me as I do not have the best memory.  For example, when Ken talked about asparagus during the winter is as bad for the planet as beef as it has been flown from South America I thought that was some of the new information that Ken was talking about.  However, after a minute I remembered that was something he mentioned in the previous video.  80% of all flights are done by 1% of the people on the planet.  This fact still shocks even hearing it a second time.  This shows how privileged people in America are and even more the people that fly frequently and waste so many carbon emissions.  The issue is complicated however because I know if I lived in New York and wanted to go home from Summer I would not take a train even if that is the Climate-friendly way to go.  I would 100% instead take a flight so I can understand why people continue to fly so frequently even though it is the worst thing we can do for the climate.  Another take away from this video is that voting is Huge to help the Climate Crisis cause.  As Ken said, " The single most important thing you can do which only takes an hour or two is voting".  March 3rd was voting time for all us and was huge if Bernie was voted for and won California, this shows Congress and the Senate that California cares about the Green New Deal and the Climate Crisis and if they make it a priority in policies they push for we will vote for them.  One vote goes a long way and can truly change what policies get enacted here in the United States.

JOHNATHAN SAFRAN FOER!! I love this author so much, but didn’t know he wrote a book on climate change! That's so awesome
	<br><br>
I appreciate the sum up. It helps to put things in an overall big picture. What we eat and how we eat is extremely important. Freeganism and Veganism are very important. We produce so much food waste, and a large percentage of that could be eaten. 
	<br><br>
Educating women and girls academically as well as on contraceptives and providing contraceptives is extremely important. Our population is growing exponentially and often by unwanted pregnancies. Women who are academically educated tend to have less children, and women who have knowledge about and access to contraceptives have less children.
	<br><br>
Transportation is another huge factor in our carbon footprint. Biking, walking and using public transportation is exponentially more beneficial to the environment, but it also can be fun. Public transportation allows you to be part of a community. Biking and walking keeps you physically closer to nature and less blocked from society.
	<br><br>
Cutting down on consumerism is another big factor. In the US we consume so much more than we need. We consume things because we want to. We are under the impression that stuff makes us happy, however it has been proven time and time again that stuff doesn't make us happy, and often actually makes us more unhappy, and also makes us want more. Specifically fast fashion is extremely problematic because of the extremely rapid process of making the clothes, as well as the projected lifespan of the clothes. We buy so many clothes that are actually made of petroleum, which is obviously bad for the planet, but bad for us as well.

“Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet” is one of the most informative lecture videos I’ve watched in this class. I liked that Ken gave a clear breakdown of each solution and why it was so important. I personally believe that all the solutions he provided is something we can all implement in our day to day lives. For example, I understand that going vegan can be hard, so why not start out being vegetarian a couple days a week. No one is forcing anyone to change their entire diet but we can all start somewhere. As someone who is currently vegetarian I still struggle with committing to a vegan diet. However, after taking this class and watching this video I want to put more effort into trying to become vegan. 

	<br><br>

Another reason that this lecture was one of my favorites is the fact that Ken brought up so many important voting issues. There are so many people in the US who don’t vote because they think their vote doesn’t matter. These people fail to realize that their vote doesn’t just impact who is elected it also impacts what policies go into place. So many changes can be made through voting that anyone who can vote should vote!

I completely agree with your point that this list offers a variety of ways individuals, like ourselves, can alter our lives to benefit the environment. While some may not be able to become fully vegan because of dietary restrictions or medical conditions, they may be able to cut down on their greenhouse gas emissions in other ways such as by buying less unnecessary items or using public transportation more often. Personally, some of the takeaways from the list that I implement or will begin incorporating into my daily life include biking often, voting for environmental initiatives, and being conscious with my food choices. 
	<br><br>


I love the idea that making a societal change is as easy as getting people talking about the issue at hand and that activism can be as passive as voting or spreading awareness to your friends and family through a conversation about climate change. In present day, we witness how many different videos, songs, and people become popular because they’re “trending” online all the time. Lately, trends including thrifting and using metal straws or reusable bottles to “Save the Sea Turtles” have been popularized just because people opened up conversations surrounding the environment and displayed their advocacy online.
<br><hr>

I agree that it is the most informative lecture video since the beginning of this class. I have bookmarked it for future reference and to give myself (and hopefully others) a reminder of the many things we can do collectively to mitigate the effects of our actions on the climate. One of the most important points he makes is the education of girls and women as a vital way to save the planet. Not only does it ensure fewer children are born, but it also allows women equal access, something that men have enjoyed throughout the entirety of human existence. It allows for everyone to make their own well-informed decisions as individuals as well as a fair contribution as a collective effort. 
	<br><br>


I also agree that these things are something that most people can implement in their daily lives. An issue that some of the films brought about was the inaccessibility of certain lifestyle changes to the lower class people. Without an inclusive action plan, saving the planet will be much more difficult. Ken provides us this easy-to-follow list so that we can all begin to make meaningful changes to our everyday life and hopefully, these changes will begin to take place on a systematic level throughout the world.
<br><hr>
In the lecture, Ken talks about the personal, political and collective actions that everyone can do to make a difference in climate change. For example, like eating a plant-based diet that can reduce tons of carbon emissions, so the demand of meat like beef, pork and chicken will decrease and lead to the decrease of supply of those meat. A lot of the things listed in the lecture can be easily done by people if they start to pay attention and understand the meaning behind them. We can save a lot of resources and control the carbon emissions if everyone on the planet decides to follow those suggestions.

It is necessary to remind ourselves of what is important in life and our passions.  When we truly see how beautiful and precious our world is, it becomes apparent of how badly we need to stop climate change. Just a couple of days ago I took a trip with the lab I am interning in.  We went in a fishing boat out of Santa Barbara Harbor towards Santa Cruz island, collecting samples through freediving.  Leaving early in the morning, I do not think I could have imagined how full of life and energy the ocean was, even in the misty morning gloom.  We saw so many pods of dolphins that swam right near our boat, schools of fish just underneath the surface, and even a shark just minding his (or her!) own business.  This was the first time I had been able to see for myself how gorgeous our world is.  I have been in love with the ocean for all of my life, but I never got to experience firsthand everything I had learned and imagined about it.  Later, while collecting samples, we took a break to explore a kelp forest nearby.  To see all the different organisms coexisting in perfect untouched balance, I knew that was exactly how it should stay.  Finding that passion that I had for environmentalism again almost made it stronger and was extremely important, as it has kept me on my toes in this class. I have found that before I was taking it as a class, now I am taking it because I want to learn more how to be the steward of our Earth that I want to be.  I appreciate Ken’s overview of everything he has told us as it is very needed to remind us how to be better as individuals and for the environment.

Hello, I just wanted to say how touching your comment is and how essential it is for others to recognize the beauty of our collective home. If other people took the time to appreciate the magnificence of the nature around them, I'm sure that they would develop the same passion for the well-being of the planet just as you have. Unfortunately, there are those who prefer to engage in a materialistic lifestyle and see luxuries as the only things worth working for. They become slaves to the inconsequential. Fortunately for us, there are classes like English 23 that provide people with the essential information to become better, eco-friendly individuals!

I think this was one of the most practical and successful lectures of the class. What the public needs is truly just concise facts and things that need to be done in order to get them to act. No one is going to sit and read through an essay or video picking it apart piece by piece to try and decide what they need to be doing. As Ken said, "pulling it all together", is the best way to present the information to a generalized population of people with all different lifestyles. 20 things that everyone collectively can do. nothing else to it. That leaves out the wiggle room for people to make excuses about what they can or can not do and leaves them to just accepting these solutions that are applicable to everyone. I am a part of the group who thinks that in order for people to act, we cannot just talk about the negatives because it will simply bring people down and make them believe that we are doomed and that nothing can be done. We need to alter the way we look at this issue in a more optimistic way and let people know that as long as we can do these easy things, we will be fine. Discouraging people will not make any change happen. If this lecture alone became viral, I think it would make a difference in at least getting people to realize its easier than they may think and that the whole world does not need to be completely flipped upside down in order to make positive changes. 
	<br><br>

This is the kind of material that should be exposed in the media, not whether or not the Kardashians got plastic surgery. We need to be a part of the generational change that puts this information into the public as we are the ones who have the power to represent a great deal of power in the media today. If one girl can make millions and have such a large following from becoming tik tok famous overnight from a single dance, I think that information like this can be spread too and really make an impact.

<p>
Thanks Ken for putting the 20 things we could do as an individual. After all this lecture and film, I felt more optimistic about the changes we could bring. In the past I would think that people who still consume meat product seems immoral after they learn about the negative impact on their doing. However, there are still more things we could do, such as take more public transportation. If everyone starts doing one or two items on the list, they could always make a difference. Understandably, some solution is more difficult for some people. Therefore there are plenty of more different options.  
	<br><br>
After ten weeks of lecture, I am willing to share this information with my family and friends, and call on changes. The most important thing is like what Gandhi said: being the change we want to see in the world.

When I first joined the class, i thought that the most important thing that could solve the climate crisis was Technology. Through technology we would find great solutions, that would make it economically viable to do the right thing and would force industries to move and adapt and eventually become sustainable. While I am still a big believer in technology, Ken's class has helped me realize that there are so many more things that are important. The two that stand out is activism, and voting. 
	<br><br>

It saddens me that still to this day for the majority of people the environment is not the major factor in deciding who to vote for, not only that, but many people vote against the most environmentally-friendly candidates for fear that they will introduce changes that will hurt the economy or their jobs. Very soon after enrolling in this class I realized what this was all about. Ken is getting a lot of people in a room, talking to them about the climate crisis and making them read and view more stuff about it. Then in the end when any logical human being would reach the same conclusions as him and be by his side he tries to make them take part in the movement actively, in whatever way everyone can or is willing to. By making us watch youtube videos about climate change not only does he get to spend more direct time with us, talking about the issues, but also urges the youtube algorithm to keep showing us such videos by other sources. * Ken needs to maybe make a better job at trying to associate his videos with other videos about the environment so this can be fully effective *.

I want to really thank you for what you are doing Ken. I am proud to be your student, I was always on your side, on our side, on the side of humanity and planet earth, and will continue to do my best to contribute to our mission. Thanks again, and keep walking my friend.

I love how this video points out how dynamic the climate crisis and how many different things contribute to this big issue and how we do in fact have the individual ability to counteract the problem we have sparked. I too thought technology was the only solution and I still think it can be a part of that, but now I believe we need to each choose to be the solution. Voting through elections or through buying intentionally is powerful and we are each very influential especially with social media. I did not choose to eat a plant-based diet for environmental reasons, but it is one of the reasons now I still choose a plant-based diet each day. I wish the video didn’t show a bunch of fruit because you can make any meal plant-based and I’ve really learned that this past year and it has blown my mind. Have your pancakes have your burritos and croissants and protein shakes, just make substitutions. Small substitutions such as almond milk rather than cow milk or flax seeds rather than eggs or marinated tempeh instead of chicken makes a huge difference and can taste just as good. Showing just a bunch of fruit (though I find that appealing) does not always make a plant-based diet approachable.

I am also upset that the environment is not taken into consideration by most people when they vote. In fact, I am annoyed that it is something we even have to vote on and that we even got to this point and continue to grow in the wrong direction. This class has given me hope and has educated me on how to embody the mindset of a climetarian in my own life even though I don’t like how this class is structured. I think in lecture we should not just read comments but focus on how to implement these ideas into our lives like look at vegan cooks or cities who bike (which we did and I loved) or look at climate movements that we can join or be a part of. I personally think this class could have taken that extra step and am disappointed it didn’t. 3 hours a week for 10 weeks could have made a bigger difference.

<br><hr>
Agreed! I have learned so much about how to help the environment from this class. I really thought that I was doing enough and I was doing my part to mitigate climate change. Boy was I wrong. I really did not know that going vegan would help the climate crisis that significantly, and I thought that driving electric cars would actually help the planet rather than hurt it. There are many things that I wish to share to my friends and family now and I would love to introduce new lifestyle changes into their lives. I really feel like this class made an impact for everyone and it is amazing how a class of about 800 people was able to be so captivated and involved in this learning process. I feel as if no one knew absolutely everything in this class environmentalist or not, and everyone was able to learn something from these lessons. 
	<br><br>


Ken did a great job of summing up the most important parts of this class in this video as a send off into real life to apply these things to our lives after the class is over. Now that there is even more awareness among others who already were pretty aware, hopefully it will make a larger impact on campus and eventually on a bigger scale such as the state or nation. I am excited to see how this class has changed such a large audience of people who are now going to go out and spread it to others.

In my first couple environmental studies classes here at UCSB I also believed that technology was the key to getting humans out of the climate crisis. This was before classes like ENGL 22 and 23 that revealed the true roots of environmental degradation such as unregulated economies, consumer societies, and lack of accountability. Through Ken's lectures, class material, and other classes here it has been made clear that fundamental changes in how we live our lives must be done in order to save the planet. His list of 20 strategies does an amazing job of summarizing the most important and meaningful efforts that one can do themselves. The fact of the matter is that we simply cannot wait for climate deniers to 'come around' or for climate engineering technology (e.g. reflective balloons) to save the human race from itself. I hope every student taking this class takes at least one of these actions/methods to heart and makes an effort to embody the change that we need.

This video is an excellent conclusion for this class (Engl23). After so many series, Ken eventually picked up 20 items, 10 on the individual level and 10 on political or collective level. I am happy to find that most of the solutions in this video are familiar, which means that I did learn something and keep them in my mind. I think this lecture video is another version of “Project Drawdown”. It gives readers some practical solutions to mitigate the climate crisis. Moreover, by precise and concise words, Ken successfully explained the effects of these solutions separately and the reasons why we need to take action right now. I will definitely recommend this video to my friends, as it puts a map of saving the world into a 24-minute video. It will be better if people find it interesting after watching this short video and then pay more attention to this global issue. 
	<br><br>
Anyhow, these solutions are basically first-world solutions to first world problems, so they may not apply to some people. I hope we can have another version of the guide plan for people in the developing world one day. However, since we already have this plan, we should follow these solutions, all of them, to change ourselves and then the whole world before it is too late. All in all, I believe that more and more people will come and join us with the widespread of Ken’s videos. Amazing job!

I agree that this lecture was a great way to conclude the class, and that in it Ken did a great job of summarizing ways in which we can all help to solve many of the complex issues that surround the climate crisis. I also found many of the solutions that Ken suggested familiar, such as his suggestions to reduce food waste or stop driving a car, but a few of the things that he mentioned were solutions that I had not thought of much prior to watching the lecture. For example, Ken suggests in the individual level portion of the lecture that we should switch to renting, borrowing or exchanging much of the stuff we use, rather than  simply buying everything in the "relentless acquisition of stuff" that he mentions. Though these are very simple ideas, I often overlook them and tend to see things that I only rarely use, such as a drill or cd player, as a need rather than something that can be shared between many people. I blame part of this apparent "need" for every tool, gadget or clothing item on the marketing of the companies who make them, as it seems they all want us to see their products as must-haves that we cannot live without. Regardless, Ken's suggestion to switch to a system or renting, exchanging and borrowing is a great one, and I will attempt to implement this among my friends and family.

	<br><br>

Additionally, I too noticed that these solutions were all for our first-world problems, and thus may not apply to those living in developing countries. Regardless of this, I believe that if we begin to follow these suggestions as soon as possible, those in the developing world will take note and also implement some of these ideas into their own lives. While this is not a guarantee, I think that if we start right away and continue to improve the sustainability of our lifestyles great change could be made!


<br><hr>
I agree with you that this is a great lecture wrapping up what we have discussed throughout the quarter, by listing 20 things we can do from the individual perspective and the perspective that views the society as a whole. From eating as a vegan or freegan, eating as a climatarian is the ultimate target for all people to get. Starting from now, it doesn’t mean you can’t eat the cheeseburgers or mac and cheese right now, but one should consider maybe adding less layers to your burgers, buy exact amount or maybe little less ingredients you need, and never discard any part of food that actually is edible. Also, taking bike to work or school, walk instead of drive to the grocery store nearby, take a long trip by plane instead of several short ones by plane, all actions mentioned above are easy to be switched into, and actually have big impact on one’s total CO2 footprints. Being the change you want to be and we need to start right now.
<br><hr>
I also agree that this video was an excellent way to summarize all of the ways we can individually and collectively take action for our climate. I think that this video would be especially informative for people outside of the English 23 community because it provides a detailed analysis of what any ideal can do as well as provides some basic facts that support each argument. I think many people want to play a role in helping the cause but do not often know where to start. This video offers a clear and concise list of ways we can get involved.
 	<br><br>

Regarding your comment on the idea that this video does not provide a detailed list for the developing world, I think this was done intentionally by Ken. I think he did not include this for a few reasons. Firstly, the majority of the problems that have created the climate crisis have been created by highly developed countries. The majority of all emissions come from the United States and the UK. Therefore, I do not think that the developing world should be prompted to change their lifestyles when they are not contributing as negatively as we are. We are the root of the cause, and we should be changing our lifestyles to stop it. Secondly, I think that this YouTube video was created to reach the students of this class as well as others around the country. We are all living in a very developed country which makes the video very relevant to us.

I think that I liked this lecture video the most out of all the ones I have watched so far in this class.  Much like the reading assignment for the top 25 changes the world needs to make to change the course of our climate crisis, this video put the English 23 course into a easy to follow summary.  Looking back on many of the things we have covered in this class I realized that a lot of these changes really do not seem to be that difficult to make on an individual scale.  Although socially there may be a great deal of turmoil as we collectively try and transition into a green way of living, I didn't think that many of these changes would make my life drastically worse.  The one thing I have yet to accept I may need to change my habits with is flying, as even though it may be the number one contributor to my climate footprint I frankly cannot foresee a future where I do not have access to air travel.  But nonetheless I think that everyone will find something on this list that upsets them, maybe they absolutely love eating beef, or want to have a very large family someday.  Even though people may be adamant about not changing one or two things on this list however, I think that overall most people would be willing to accept most of the changes presented.  In the future when hopefully we begin to take collective action on the climate crisis I think that almost everyone will accept most of the changes on this list but few people will accept all of them, and that is alright.  If there is a beef lover out there and they are willing to pay a hefty carbon tax to eat beef maybe it isn't the worst thing, as long as they make all the other changes, as overall the number of people eating beef will be reduced to a hopefully manageable amount.  It is all about moderation, and into which possibly climate damaging areas we put our limited carbon footprints towards.  As long as we as a collective lower our carbon footprints down to safe levels, after that we will be able to indulge ourselves in the occasional climate unsafe activity if we love it and make sure that we still managing our overall footprints.

I agree with your comment and thought it was very well said. I also really enjoyed this video and liked how Ken divided the video into first individual actions that will help mitigate the climate crisis, and then political/collective action. It did a great job of not only summarizing this course, but also summarizing what we can do to help the climate crisis, and in my opinion, in a non intimidating and approachable way. I think it's great that you emphasized the point that while people may not accept every single suggestion, most of them seem reasonable and adoptable, and it is okay if there is something you just cannot give up and are willing to pay the price for that specific change. I believe that if we are going to accomplish anything, it is not the best approach to shame or put others down for their choices and decisions. Personally, I have seen many ridicule their peers for not making the changes we hope to see in everyone. We have to remember that for many, some of these changes are very impactful and have different meanings, and it will take time to adjust and accept that these changes are for the sake of our planet. While I am well aware that we are running out of time and the time to act is now, in most cases pushing ideas and changes on others will not be positive, but deterring and discouraging to those we are trying to educate. I think it is better to educate in other ways like Ken has suggested previously, such as letting others come to you with questions or concerns instead of being so outward. I agree in saying that the emphasis should be on lowering your overall carbon footprint in any way you can, and strive to act and make choices with the climate in mind. And of course if you see nothing you are willing to change, then at least vote for those who will make the changes necessary to make a real change in the mitigation of the climate crisis.


<br><Hr>
I really enjoyed a lot of the lecture videos in the class but I also think this one might be my favorite. I really liked how you said that this video put the class English 23 into an easy to follow summary. Once Americans also believe that these changes won’t make life drastically worse, America would be able to transition into a green way of living. Until then, like you said, it is important for us individually to make these changes in our lives, Movements start with a small group and successful ones eventually become widespread. I think that the environmental movement will definitely become bigger and more effective and as more and more students learn about the climate crisis, I think it will become easier to combat it. I also agree with you when it comes to flying. It is very difficult for me to see myself not flying to visit my family and go back to my home country. I think that it is important for people to start by doing things that seem more feasible to them and eventually shift into actions that might be more difficult. As a collective, we can still lower emissions in this way and, like you said, we can indulge ourselves in the occasional climate unsafe activity.

This lecture video was a great capstone to the entire quarter’s material. It highlighted the important action items presented throughout the different readings, films, and lectures we went through. If anyone asks what this class is about, or what they can do to help the planet in terms of the climate crisis, sharing this video is an easy way to answer them. Every point presented in this video is important in its own way in contributing to the battle against the climate crisis.
	<br><br>
The solution that I resonate the most with from the first half of the list is number four. Ken mentions that educating girls will ultimately lower the population growth rate. Many people do not realize how fast exponential growth explodes. Even with a constant birth rate, the population will only grow faster and faster. Clearly, limiting birth rates is of great importance. In addition, I find that education is extremely important in general for all cases. As noted by Ken, knowledge is an essential tool for anyone to have. Increasing access to education in general will only benefit in preventing an irreversible climate crisis, as well as other injustices that people face.
	<br><br>
The solution in the second half of the list that I like the most is number twenty. This feels like a non-answer as this solution essentially encapsulates every other solution presented. However, it really is the foundation of any change that will happen. Whether it is personal action, activism, and political action, it all starts with someone that sees a change. If every person who wanted to see change in our current climate crisis became the change they wanted to see, there would be no question that we could prevent or at least slow the climate crisis.

I really enjoyed this video because it encapsulates not only all of the themes and solutions that we learned throughout this course, but it also makes me realize how much I have learned about the climate crisis since being in Ken’s class. Before this class, I knew a good amount about the climate crisis. However, even with my background knowledge on the topic, I cannot tell you how many times that I had “OHH” or “WoW” moments. The things that I learned, not only an environmental standpoint, but a political and social one, is extremely invigorating. 
	<br><br>


With that being said, there are two solutions that truly stand out. The first one being the idea that we should educate more women and girls. This is a must. Not only does it prevent an increase in population, but it just makes our society better. This solution is all-encompassing, considering the social mobility that women can gain from being more educated or pursuing higher education. I believe that there is a huge disparity in the way that we view men and women scholars and elites, and to even make a distinction is completely unacceptable. Competence is competence in any form. So, to make sure that we understand that, education for women is extremely vital. 
	<br><br>


The second solution that I find extremely interesting is the idea that we should vote for more environmentally sustainable initiatives, which is an interesting one because it holds political weight. What does that mean exactly? Well, this holds partisan bias (which to me is baffling). However, what I do NOT recommend is putting other people down because of their beliefs. Instead, we have to allow others to understand that climate change is not a partisan or political issue, even though, unfortunately, it has become just that. We just have to try.


<br><hr>
Thanks for the reply! I really resonate with the idea of educating more women and girls. As Ken said, this is a win, win, win situation. There are literally no downsides to increasing the access and quality of education for more people. I do not understand why anyone would want to prevent access to education, besides for selfish and corrupt reasons. 
	<br><br>
I found your statement about voting for environmentally sustainable initiatives interesting. I agree that it is weird for these ideas to represent partisan opinions. Why should saving the planet for humans, as well as other living things, be a political decision? Personally it seems clear that we should try to present a livable and sustainable world to future generations. I also agree that we should not put people down because of their beliefs. I believe this once again boils down do an issue relating to education. We must somehow curb the ignorance that pervades certain groups, causing them to deny that climate change is occurring and that taking action against it is not necessary or even harmful. Better education, as well as effective communication is key in helping people understand that climate change is not a political issue.

I think this video is great. Ken tells us a few suggestions about how to reduce the effects brought by greenhouse gases and what we can do to reduce the usage of greenhouse gases. Since greenhouse gases are the major causes of climate change, greenhouse gases lead to the increase of temperature and the increase of temperature leads to climate change.  First, Ken suggests us to eat less meat and eat more vegetables. As when the time we produce meat, we produce two to three-times of greenhouse gases then we produce vegetables. So eating less more meat and more vegetables can reduce the releasing greenhouse gases. Second, we should buy fewer things. As we waste two-third of the things we produced. And when we are producing these goods, we release a lot of greenhouse gases. Therefore, these three suggestions are really useful.

This was a great video on the summary of the lecture. Though it doesn't address a lot of the root of the problems and the fact that we need a revolution to change this corrupt system, it was a great summary for privileged individuals to take actions and use their privilege to give voice and light to those that do not get as much attention. I believe that noting where injustices are and bringing light to those places can also be very helpful in mitigating climate change and reduce carbon emissions. Everything we do as human beings that doesn't help with the harmony of this Earth is actually pretty unnecessary and can be abolished. yay protests!

we are all privileged just living in this country... and especially going to this school. Yay protests! this was indeed a great summary of the class and solutions that everybody can  take to better our situation in terms of warming the earth. one of the best things to do that Ken does not mention is to just live simpler. we don't need anything fancy in order to survive. quite the opposite: we NEED water, calories, sex, and shelter. that's it. if you want to break it down. the reason that people in undeveloped parts of the world have relatively no impact on the planet is because they live within their means and only buy things that are absolutely necessary. if we all did that, we would not have a problem. it is the consumer culture that is killing us from the inside out...

<br><hr>
I agree! I think that we should just go back to our roots. Our ancestors and see what they have been doing that has worked all this time. I want to see what is the best way, with the lowest impact possible, that we can live. I agree with what you mentioned about the absolute necessities being food, water, shelter, resources. If we are able to self-sustain, then we can help the Earth sustain.

Probably the most important points out of all of these are those that concern the spread of knowledge. I know many people who are hesitant to talk about political or social issues because it's not cool or whatever. But that's bullshit. It is so much cooler to be the change than to sit idly and wait for it to come. We need to have the conversations with our friends and our family because our sole impact is not sufficient. I'm going to make an Instagram post about what I learned in this class so that people can find out what they can and should do to change the course of this planet. This is highly unlikely, but if every one of my 750 Instagram followers (assuming they all ate beef beforehand) saw my post and all decided to become vegetarian, I could save 1,200 tons of CO2 per year (https://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html). That's so much more effective than switching from beef to vegetarianism myself, which only saved 1.6 tons of CO2.
	<br><br>

All these 20 changes can have a substantially greater effect if made by more people. So our primary goal in climate action to be spread our knowledge. That's something that we all, as ordinary citizens, have all the power to do.

I like that you differentiated between the things we as individuals can do to save the planet and the things that we can do revolving politics and activism. I feel like as much as I want to be able to make individual choices that will lead to large scale changes to protect our environment, there aren't many that will actually do so. In my opinion the most effective thing we can do as climate crisis believers is to take political action and push for environmental activism, that way we are more likely to make global changes that can offer more benefits to our future. I also liked that at the end of the video you differentiated between the responsibilities of us as Americans versus the responsibilities of third world countries. It's incredibly evident that we are the most responsible for the climate crisis and should therefore be held more accountable. I hope that people begin to realize this and put more pressure on the United States to make the changes necessary and make going green a priority.

I like Ken's argument that he constantly reiterates: Knowledge is not power but enacting upon it is. It's not enough that we know and are conscious of the climate crisis and solutions, but rather the true solution is actually doing these things like voting and changing dietary habits and not flying and everything else. Like Ken said, "Talk is cheap" and it would be awesome if in this class, rather than take exams, we are graded on how much CO2e we reduce from our daily lives or roles we take in activism (im not just saying this to avoid the final )! Even with everything you listed out Ken, i would be surprise if a fraction of people followed through with actually doing and of these things to save the planet. It's often the case that we all agree with know that there is a certain problem in the world, but actually doing something about it is a different story. This is why i believe a practical application of doing  any of these 20 things we learned in a class, would be a great gateway into continuing them and  integrating other solutions (like bike riding or voting) into our lives. However, this is unrealistic since i doubt the University would allow it and also because it would be very difficult to grade people based on experience (cool idea tho). As we approach the end of the quarter, I really do believe i learned things that i can apply to myself. Of the 20 things you have listed, I can confidently say that the majority of them i have already integrated into my life or will integrate when applicable (like share housing or micro apartments). Even for those who are working on doing any of these solutions, do as many as you can right now (these solutions are surprisingly not that difficult to accomplish), then when you're able to do more--do more.


</p><hr>


<p>
In the lecture video, 'Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet", Ken goes over a list of solutions one can do to help the planet. This includes changing your habits when it comes to eating, living, and traveling. Individual and collective actions are crucial to reducing our carbon footprint.  We can get even greater gains if we spread the word and educate others on climate change. However, this can be particularly difficult because many people will disagree. For example, last night I attempted to tell my roommate how leaving the lights on all day can be mitigating for the climate. He immediately told me that he pays SDG&E for a reason and does not care about the repercussions it could have on the environment. I tried explaining to him how saving power can provide long term and short term benefits but he refused to agree. This really frustrated because if people who are like my roommate do not care about climate change, how can we educate them.   Next time, I do believe I can be less intimidating and be more enthusiastic about saving the planet.

I really relate to what you’re saying about running into someone who just doesn’t care. No matter how many times to tell them, explain, plead -- they don’t care and they won’t change. After listening to these 20 things, I think it’s great that Ken is giving us ways to contribute to the fight, and that so many are possible -- but it still isn’t enough if we’re being honest. We need massive structural change in how our country runs. And it’s not just us, it’s other countries around the world too. Probably the most important thing we can do is vote, because that's how we achieve that massive change, but I did that, I voted for Bernie Sanders, and he will probably lose and things will probably get worse. I really really hate to be so down and dismal but it just feels like my reality. Of course I don’t think that feeling down is an excuse not to do these things -- I will always vote for candidates who I believe will fight on behalf of the climate, and I will continue eating with the world in mind, and buying clothes second-hand, and taking the bus, etc. But it’s hard not to feel like we’re all just doomed anyway. 
	<br><br>

Nature is one of the things that makes me the most happy. This came up for me while watching the Happy documentary. I was reminded that when I’m feeling sad usually what I need is a nice long walk outside or a hike or a bike ride. But when I think about what I love about the world, and about all the things in nature that might be destroyed before I ever get to see them...well, it’s hard not to feel hopeless.

<br><hr>
I believe that Ken focused on these three points because it’s something that we at our age could achieve. Individual actions would be beneficial, but it would be even more effective when combined with collective actions. Education is essential but we have to make sure to target our audience at a younger age so it’s not too late for additional damage. I’m not saying a brainwashing method if we are providing evidence with facts about the climate crisis. I thought your roommate would say that electricity isn’t a big factor in terms of carbon emission. I would say he’s right, but I would also inform him on other more important factors affecting carbon emission such as refrigerants, wind turbines, and education of women. Also, I would probably do this in a more positive reinforcement way instead of blaming. I feel like they would appreciate it more and actually listen to what you have to say.

This week’s mini-lecture, “20 things that each of us can do to save the planet”, is established to wrap up the whole course of English 23 and is extremely informative so that we could go through it and strengthen our knowledge on this class. Ken is not only focusing on an individual level, which means everybody that is watching this video could follow his lead and start to make changes. Before watching this video, I saw it’s a 24-minute-long video, which is usually regarded as “tedious” by myself. However, this time, I kept watching it second by second and did not want to miss a word from Ken. From my perspective, this video plays the same role as “The Green New Deal” and “25 Project Drawdown” but completely on ourselves. Going along with what Ken suggests in this video, I realized that those things are actually not that difficult to be taken in actions, comparing to the vegetable-oil car invented by Peter. I think everybody could eventually find something on this list of 20 things to constantly reduce their carbon footprints and generate benefits to the environment. 
	<br><br>


To me, the number one thing that I’m going to start is to reduce my frequency of taking flights for trips. Concerning about the situation that is happening right now, I decide to cancel my flights to Atlanta for this spring break, preventing the probability of contacting with the coronavirus from increasing and cut down my carbon footprints simultaneously. This is just a little move, but I believe that many of them will make changes accumulatively.

Yes. Collective and individual actions are both actions towards a better future. Your decision to fly less and knowing that you're doing it, makes it even more rewarding when thinking about what we are each doing for the climate crisis. I hope everyone watches this video as we wrap up the quarter and realize how much information we have just learned about the climate crisis. With the end of this class, we could do as Ken discussed, and SHARE this information. What good is it to only have learned this material just for studying. This class was set up to be communicated all over. By sharing what we have learned in this course, and by watching this wrap up video, we can make a difference. Whether it be individual or collective, a minor or major lifestyle change, any of these are a step in solving the climate crisis.

Yeah, I agree that this list just perfectly sums up everything we have talked about so far in the class. What I love about the list is that it has something for everyone and they're really easy steps to help the climate crisis. I even sent this video to my family because I think out of all the other videos, this one is the most important one because it ties everything together so beautifully. I especially appreciate that the 20 things included personal actions and activism. I think we forget just how much power we have to influence our government by voting, we get discouraged and convinced that our votes mean nothing but in reality it is easily the best thing we can do for the planet. We have the power to elect leaders who actually care about saving the world and who are willing to make the necessary sacrifices to see it get done. The list also reinforced the idea of working together, a lot of the changes we can make will require us to join together and make sure that we are being heard. Together we can force the government to change it's policies or even shift our culture if enough of us get on board. We also need to spread the word, just get this information out there so more people can become informed. The biggest issue in the environmental movement is misinformation and if we can just spread some knowledge then we will see an increase in people wanting to join in.
<br><hr>
I think you did a great job at addressing exactly what Ken wanted to portray in this video. I also was a little bit annoyed when I saw how long this video was (but I just put it into 1.5 speed and I was good). After watching this video and seeing collectively what we need to do to save our planet, it did not seem so bad. With some of the things Ken was suggesting, it was a bit difficult for me to support him with the entire transportation aspect because it's not as easy as it seems... However, now that we are at the end of this class I'm starting to realize that not flying isn't even that hard, I've only ever been on a plane twice and have no reason to ever be on one anytime soon. But, majority of the stuff that he suggests that we do is not difficult at all. Things like voting, changing your diet, and spending less really does not take away from the happiness in your life at all.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with you on the fact that this video plays the same role as the “Green New Deal” and “25 Project Drawdown”. When this course first started, I remember feeling so hopeless about the future of our planet. But as we end now, with the culmination of everything Ken goes over in this video, these three prospective plans (Ken’s list, Green New Deal, and Project Drawdown) have made me more hopeful than I was before this class even started. It is very reassuring to know that this situation can be fixed, and that there are ways that we can all contribute to make positive and impactful change. 

	<br><br>


As you mentioned, Ken focuses on both the individual level and collective level actions we can take, and while realistically most people will not do all 20 things on the list, even picking and choosing some from each part can make a big difference if a large number of people get involved. For me personally, I will be focusing on switching to a more climate conscious diet, wasting less food, and educating the people around me.  I hope that if everyone picks a few things to focus on, we will be able to make significant reductions in the carbon emissions in every category on Ken’s list.

I have definitely tried adopting a plant based diet a few times before and have never lasted longer than 2-3 weeks. I love the idea of helping the environment through my diet, and I think the health benefits of a plant based diet far out weigh the effort it would take to commit to that lifestyle. That being said I also know that for a lot of cultures, including my own, meat is a big part of the diet and would be incredibly hard to fully cut out. Also, the fact that fracking had emitted more carbon dioxide than the meat industry, at least to me should be something that we tackle first. Granted changing your diet would be easier than taking the down fossil fuel companies, that is still something that should be addressed by politicians and big names. Food waste is also  a big contributor to our CO2 emissions, and is something that could easily be avoided if we all simply bought just enough food. I know one thing my mom does is only buying enough food to make a meal for that night, so that there really isn't any waste. Another thing that I thought about is sure the environment would benefit greatly from contraceptives and limiting family sizes, a lot of people don't have access to contraceptives, or with cultures that tend to have big families. I for one would love to have a big family because I come from a big family, and that isn't me trying to be selfish, but rather me trying to live the life I want. Also the whole car argument is valid, as they do release 4.6 metric tons of CO2, but it seems a bit unrealistic because for example, people coming from the suburbs to try and bus to the city rather than must drive. That being said the fact that if I were to buy a car every 11 years I would have expended my allotted CO2 emissions is crazy to think about that. Ken also talked about co-housing and while I really do like the idea of that, I don't see many Americans or really anyone who doesn't need to moving into co-housing. Also, living in the city may be appealing to some, but I for one wouldn't consider living in the city if I were trying to raise a family.

This lecture is more like a compilation of the most practical personal actions that we can take in order to help with our planet. Almost all of the solutions have been mentioned in the previous readings or lectures. When I learned about the changes that we could make at the meal table, I doubted how much I could actually change. However, I have noticed that, I consume beef less often nowadays and drink almond milk rather than regular milk. Communication is also a good way to get more efforts in saving our planet. I talked to my RA in the dorms last night and surprisingly found out that she knew about the damages brought by animal agriculture and had avoided the consumption of beef for a long time. I’ve also flown less this year. It is difficult to look for alternative transportations for long distance travel, so I just simply fly less. I know that I have just started and what I have been isn’t much. There are definitely a lot more people who are more committed than I am, but I hope I can keep the change that I have started and strive for more changes.

This video acts as a concluding episode of the previous segments, in which Ken combines both personal and collective actions each of us can take to mitigate the climate crisis. I was fascinated by the point about empowering women and providing equal education. As suggested by Ken, it’s a win-win-win tactic as more education works effectively in boosting equal rights among different genders and controlling birth rates. Coming from a large populated country, I was able to detect how competitive life is inside a generation. Ken also discusses many other feasible solutions such as reducing unnecessary purchases and supporting fair trade products. This minimalism approach can cultivate people into a attitude of valuing quality more than quantity and thus reduce waste. Finally, I get exposed to the significance of voting, which is considered to be the simplest and the single most important thing a normal citizen can do to take part in saving the planet. It’s great to see how people are promoting the importance of voting in public and how positively people are responding to it.

I relate to your connection with the solution of educating women. Out of all the solutions, I greatly appreciate that Ken insists contraceptive use and the end of unwanted pregnancies on an individual scale is up to both partners. I once read that men could stop all unwanted pregnancies simply by not having sex with women. Too often, it falls to the woman to take charge of her and her partner's reproductive outcomes, even though "it takes two to tango." I've long considered myself a feminist, and while that's often associated with moving women into a "man's world," I personally think that we should encourage more men to take a look at a woman's world. (And maybe someday, we can just share a world. Idealistic, I know.)
	<br><br>

Beyond that, I'm not sure I have much to add. I don't want to call this an "exhaustive" list, because I didn't feel exhausted when I listened to the video. Instead, I felt invigorated, hopeful, and optimistic. Ken, when you lay out these 20 things as plainly as you did, it makes people think that we have a chance to change the climate crisis. (And we do!) Furthermore, these suggestions (equal education, a better bartering and trading network, access to wholesome, local food, and a more politically active society) will not only combat the climate crisis, but make the U.S. a better nation, one hopefully based on needs of the collective over the avarice of a few.
	<br><br>

As we're drawing close to the end of this course, I would just like to thank you, Ken, for providing such a well-rounded, single resource that I can easily share with my friends and family. I look forward to being the change with you, and with all of my peers in the class.

As Ken said, most of this lecture was in fact review. That doesn't negate the importance of this comprehensive list, however. Something I've noticed, and admittedly even complained about myself, is that these lectures and concepts can be pretty repetitive. You know what, thought? That's because this information NEEDS to be drilled into us. Not only are humans inherently ignorant creatures, we're quite forgetful too. These issues need to be on the mind, they need to be part of the discussion. These numbers are staggering because they're detrimental, the facts are crazy because if gone unchecked they'll result in something from a science fiction novel. It's videos like these that make me so appreciative of Ken's unconventional approach towards an open course. Obviously, there's so much to get into in knowing about the climate crisis, but there's also something to be said about a 20-item list condensed into just 24 minutes, and with rather impressive details. 

	<br><br>

Repetitive? Maybe. Important. More than many people realize. Our planet relies on fixing these issues else the results will be just as bad as they're projected to be. Be need to act both personally and politically, as Ken points out, in order for anything to give way.

<p>
Like many others, I think that this is a good way to summarize the course and wrap it all up into one. There's so much that we can do to mitigate climate change, all of which I hope to do during my lifetime. I think that the list of things that we can do as a collective whole is the next giant leap that we need to make to keep this wave moving. 
	<br><br>

Before taking this class (and attending UCSB), the only things I really knew about stopping climate change were recycling, carpooling, and other small simple stuff. This class and just being in such an environmentally progressive environment like SB has been such a welcoming and fun change for me. Having people around that push for greener initiatives not only widens people's perspectives but it generates a lot of movement among the general population. It really feels like you're a part of something. This class has taught me about the gravity of the situation and all the statistics and numbers and things that we can do to combat that, and it's truly amazing to have all of this knowledge; it's really converted me to more than just composting food and recycling. Climate change is a movement and it's a cause full of passion and love for the earth; it's like nothing I've seen with my own eyes. Ken really took on this class on a whim, and I think it was the right choice. This class has brought so much more attention to the climate crisis, and it was great to be able to sit in during lecture and learn what else we can do to help out. It really shifted my perspective and brought into light an issue that I didn't know much about 5 years ago. Now, it's something that I really care about and that's something I wouldn't have thought back then. It's crazy how this really impacted the class and how all of this newfound knowledge really opened our eyes. But Ken also said before that "knowledge is power squandered." Although we won't have this class in the future, we should revitalized our passion for the earth and this cause and keep doing what we need to do to mitigate climate change and reduce our carbon footprint.

The list of 20 things is composed by two parts: personal actions and collaborative actions. Clearly, personal actions are inevitable and crucial in order to reverse the climate crisis; however, the relative significance of collaborative actions are nonetheless even greater. To maximize our ability to reverse the climate change, we should accomplish as much as what we can do as an individual as well as sparking collaborative actions. As a person, what we can do can be classified into following categories: food, birth control, transportation, housing, and stuff. We need to switch into a largely plant-based diet as well as waste less food; we need to educate girls equally as boys while ensuring their access to abortion; we need to use mass transportation or biking rather than cars and encourage slow traveling; we need to live in smaller houses; we need to practice minimalism as much as possible and recycle our items. In addition, we need to work collaboratively. One of the easiest and most significant thing that we can do is to vote. Voting for those who can make policies that are environmentally friendly is the biggest guarantee of our success in mitigating climate crisis. Also, we need to take the power away from companies that are harming our environment, including fossil fuel industries and beef industries. We need to gain more knowledge about the truth of global warming and communicate the idea with people around us to build an environmental awareness. Last but not least, we need to act and be the change to the world we would like to see.

While I agree with you that these things do include both personal and collective actions, I do not think there is really any difference between them in practice. Personal action is useless without complete collective action. Let me explain: it is sadly undeniable that most of the personal actions listed are only effective at combatting the climate crisis if they are adopted by a massive amount of the population. For instance, limiting your air travel is only useful if enough people reduce their flights in order to force airlines to reduce the number of flights offered. While this isn't to say there is no value in personal action for reasons other than limiting CO2, as we saw in the movie for this week, we need broad societal buy-in on most of these lifestyle changes in order for there to be actual effects on our climate. For this reason, in practice, all of these things are collective action that begins on a personal level. 
	<br><br>
I think one of the most interesting points of discussion in this class is how personal action can influence collective action and vice versa. An example of the former would be how people making lifestyle changes in visible ways, such as driving electric vehicles, can cause other people to become environmentally conscious.  The latter would be how legislative change can shift societal perspectives on issues and cause people to make changes in their own life. What I get from this observation is that this phenomenon is akin to a positive feedback loop. The more collective action, the more personal action, and vice versa. Therefore, regardless of whether we start on a personal level or with top-down government action, we can accelerate the cycle of change.

I really liked hearing all of the solutions together. Honestly, it sounds long but really doable. If everyone in this class who said they wanted to get involved in activism started working on institutionalizing these kinds of changes statewide or in our communities, we could achieve so much. It needs to become easy to make these changes. For example, if we all spent 1 hour collecting petitions for creating community garden space in our local towns (which already exists in IV!), 800 people could collect 20 petitions an hour, ending up with 16,000 petitions that elected officials would take notice of. Then, that elected official could make it happen and provide an entire town with a more sustainable food option. Of course there’s multiple ways to organize, but grassroots representation is one of them. 
	<br><br>

I really liked the part in the ‘Happy’ movie where they talked about intrinsic values. If we all prioritized our intrinsic values of love and community service, we would all be better off. It’s kind of frustrating to see that it seems so clear what the better option is and still in reality see that the ones who are actively hurting people and their well-being (massive corporations often) are the ones with the most power because we’ve created a society where money = power. But it’s also hopeful to see that countries like Denmark and Sweden exist, where they’re in a slightly better place and have accepted some of those well-being priorities.

I agree with how you pushed forward the idea of how much power lies in this class being 800 students strong. If we all wanted to get into some sort of activism, all it takes is just consistent effort in order to create a movement which will gain enough traction based on numbers alone. There is so much power in having each of us create change in unique ways, but when we all collaborate on one effort, be it signing petitions like Hana said or bringing this information to the greater spotlight of others who wouldn’t have access to it normally, I’m sure that we could create positive sustainable change.
	<br><br>

I also really feel like delving into participating into local gardens can be extremely beneficial in not only environmental efforts, but also creating a community centered around creating growth. Community has come up time and time again in this class and with this topic, I feel like it is again necessary in order to create change that is consistent. Whether you bring this idea back to your communities in organizations or your hometown, I feel like reaching out into networks available to you is the best way to translate the information we’ve learned throughout this course into real change.

I am glad that Ken put together this lecture summarizing what we can do to help the environment going forward. It is something I can share with people, and also look back on if I ever forget. Looking at the options played out for us, I think diet is the most easily changed habit that a single person can alter for the betterment of the planet. Eating is something we do every day, and all it takes is buying a few different things from the grocery store to make a difference. Coming away from this class I will be much more aware of the food that goes to waste, and making sure I use everything I buy. Ten weeks ago I did not realize how large of an impact wasted food has on carbon emissions. I certainly did not think that it damaged the planet more than eating meat. I feel slightly torn, however. I know how bad meat, especially beef, is for the environment, but I love eating meat. I already primarily eat chicken, turkey, and fish, because that is how I was raised, but still I enjoy burgers, steak, and bacon from time to time. I feel that if I can make a conscious decision to limit my red meat intake, and waste little to no food, I can at least do a little to help the planet. Voluntary minimalism is another thing that I could see myself moving towards in the future. I already don’t love spending a whole lot of money on a bunch of stuff. I always would rather have money than spend it. So I could see myself limiting the things I buy going forward. I was happy to see that I practiced tips number eleven and twelve on Tuesday, as I voted with the environment in mind when choosing local, state, and presidential politicians. These are tips that I will carry with me for every election in the future.

This is a great video as it gives us many ways that we can make a change. Thinking about a few of them such as voting made me think that we need to be more educated on the issues and people we are voting for. With the elections and voting coming around I think it is important for us to make an effort to learn more about the candidates and see who is the person to help us out of the climate crisis. I know last year my friend said she did not know anyone’s political stands and she was blindly going to vote which I am not sure is any better than not voting. Ken is right when he said that we have to actually put the knowledge we have into practice. I wish this class also provided more of a way to do that. For example making it an assignment or our final to actually participate in one of these solutions such as spreading the word or eating like a freegan for a week. I know people that has a nutrition class last year were required to eat like a vegetarian for a day and I think that experience taught at least a few of them that being a vegetarian can be easy and fun. My brother is a vegan and has been for a couple years and he is always telling my mom and sister about how much better he feels. Like Ken also mentioned about having a group of supportive friends that share the same sustainable lifestyle it was actually easy to give up meat when I had my brother around because we shared a lot of the meals. It was nice having someone that understood, although it was not done for the climate he is doing his part to live a sustainable life.

I too agree that people need to actually become more educated on the issues and people they are voting before because I believe blind voting is worse than not voting at all. Like Ken said and like I too believe, voting is extremely important and is a crucial way to create change and guide the country in the right direction. Sadly, I believe that a lot of people go out and vote blindly for candidates that have spread word-of-mouth or just blindly "guessing" who to pick. We need to encourage more people to become educated on ALL those who are running and not simply educate people on one candidate due to popularity and bias. In order for true change to come to this country we as a people need to educate ourselves not only on our future leaders and representatives, but also on the climate crisis in general. Becoming educated on the topic would allow for the truth to be spread about the severity of climate change and allow for the spread of preventative measure to be spread. After taking this course I feel educated on what has been causing this terrible climate crisis and I feel that Ken has provided me with the major tools that I can use so that I may personally help this planet. I feel that people should no longer be able to talk falsely against this crisis as that is only leading to further catastrophe and I believe that people instead should be encouraged to take courses such as this as a way to educate themselves. 
	<br><br>

Again Brenda I agree with you that we should, in a way, actively participate in one of the solutions for climate change as a way to not only participate in this course but also as an activist for preventing climate change. I too wish this class provided more of a way to put my new knowledge into practice but I do know that a lot of the solutions take time and work in order to correctly and happily change one's life in the best interest of the planet. I was vegetarian one time and I had a hard time with it so I eventually went back to meat, but one day I like to think that I will be able to switch to that lifestyle, growing my own food and helping nourish my planet. When I was a vegetarian I was uneducated, did not eat a lot of greens, and honestly had no idea what I was doing, this is what would happen if people tried to help the climate but were uneducated on how to properly do that. Educating the world is the most effective way in creating change as the more people believe the world is going through a massive crisis the better of a chance we have to help our planet and nurse it, somewhat, back to health. I too agree that being around people who do the same as you makes it easier as you may not feel as judged and you are more encouraged to live that type of lifestyle. In order to help myself become more environmentally friendly I know I will need to find like minded people and live my life how I want while bing conscious that everything I do has a consequence somewhere else.
<br><hr>
I completely agree, right now I am seeing a lot of people influence others by providing all the positives about a candidate and withholding certain cons. Like Ken also listed in his video it is important for us to read and become more knowledgeable and I think he suggests this because I think we are the best people to make decisions for what we want our future to be. While spreading information and having productive talks with people is also important I think having our own ideas will be useful to spot the honest information from misguided information. I can’t help but to think of how the anti-climate crisis activists wrote a book and gave it to teachers for kids to learn about. That example proves that there is a lot of misguided information out there and we just have to be really informed in order to do the right thing for the climate and ourselves.

<br><hr>
I agree that this video was the most impactful out of all of them. 20 reasonable changes that we can make in our lives to help the environment. Ken was able to tie individual, collective, and political action all into one list of things that we can do. With Super Tuesday coming up tomorrow, this video becomes even more important in urging people to vote. However, like you, I have friends who are very uninformed about the current democratic candidates. Like you said, is it worth it to vote if they are going in blind and naive? I’m urging them to vote and to become informed, but I do believe that it’s going to take more than just me to convince them to educate themselves. It’s a sad reality, but many young adults are clueless when it comes to politics. If this continues to be the case, our environment is in very bad hands. This needs to change.
<br><hr>
I after giving it more thought I think it is dangerous to vote blindly than to not vote because there is a good chance that they can vote for someone that does not have the best intentions from all the other candidates. However, I think that are good amount of young people that are engaged and are educating themselves about politics. This just needs to be more widespread, but hopefully we can make this happen in order to get the best candidate to become president.

This lecture provided a great comprehensive list of actions we can take to save the planet. Most of the items are not difficult to incorporate into people’s daily lives. Changing one’s diet, using contraception, educating boys and girls fairly, etc. are manageable ways to dampen the climate crisis as long as one is motivated to act. This course has allowed me to reflect on my own habits and contributions to the climate crisis, so with these 20 things in mind, I would like to reflect on some of the habits I have changed. One major change I made has been my diet. Prior to this course, I would eat a meal consisting of some type of meat every day, sometimes for all three meals. Since this course, I have cut back on eating meat once or twice a week. The change has been slow, but through continuing this practice, I would like to have a meatless diet. I have also been more motivated to bike. Not only is does it reduce my emissions, but I genuinely love it. I mainly bike to campus due to its proximity, but have expanded to biking to places in Goleta, the farthest being Turnpike Rd. I want to recognize that I still drive, usually to go downtown for my weekly doctor’s appointment and that is about 20 miles round trip. Due to time constraints, this is one instance where I cannot bike, even if it would be a fun ride. 
 	<br><br>

Ken reminded us that knowledge is not power unless its shared. I have had the opportunity to tell people about some of the things I’ve learned in this class, and though I don’t think the information has changed their habits, it has caused them to think and ask questions, which shows me they are wanting to learn more. The desire to become more knowledgeable may lead to action, so by continuing to speak about the climate crisis, I hope more people act. We don’t necessarily have to do all of these 20 things at once, that would be overwhelming, but to add one of these changes every week, in five months, someone could drastically change their carbon footprint.

I also agree that this course has helped change my perspective to suggestions that I previously dismissed or thought weren’t applicable to myself, such as with altering my diet as you went through yourself. Among the first half of the list, I recognized this to probably be the one I took initiative on first as it was introduced early on in our course and seemed easy to do since as a freshman, my availability to food is limited to what the dining commons offer. With them already offering a lot of vegan options, I took it upon myself to be more open to incorporating more vegetables in my meals and reducing the amounts of meat I ate. While I did question what the purpose of me, one person, changing my diet would do, I began to understand the importance of personal action as we went on through the course and eventually the power of climate/political activism. Without taking action on what we’ve learned, we’re no better than those who have never heard of such suggestions and the impact it has on our planet.
	<br><br>

These suggestions display reasonable initiatives we can all take and apply to our own lives as I will be sure to be aware of and engage in as I get older. For example, I will eventually live off campus next year and will have to take into consideration the diet I will have as I will be cooking, the transportation I will be taking, and even the political action I will partake in as voting is a continual process. It is up to us to be aware of our resources and how it will be affecting our climate footprint, which is something this course has allowed me to better recognize.

These twenty things serve as a kind of summary of what we need to do as an individual action and collective action. Individual actions are hard to persist and make little changes individually, but collective actions require a great amount of time to succeed and even then the successful rate is quite low. Neither of these two are easy ways to work out climate changes and we have to do these things now. Also, Ken mentions in his video that technology itself cannot work out the problem, and I think he has talked about this many times, but I think it is quite necessary. Because we are all well-educated students, and we get involved in technological perspectives and may think that these techs are the major factors to work out of climate changes.However, that is definitely not the case, since even the rapid development after WWII didn’t stop co2 emission from skyrocked, the increase in tech efficiency may only be a disadvantage alone, to make people more greedy and consume more things as granted. Therefore, the fundamental cure for environmental protection is to arouse and alter people’s intrinsic desires of being greedy, and I am quite confident that these things can be regulated and controlled by our consciousness.

As the quarter comes to a close, and thus this class is reaching its end, I think it’s really important that we sum up the main takeaways from this class so that we, the students, don’t forget why we wanted to take this class in the first place. Ken’s lecture video does an excellent job of just that. I feel like I have gained so much valuable knowledge from this class and it has been absolutely inspiring to be surrounded by and communicate with a group of like-minded peers. Among his list of 20 things we can do, collective action and educating those around us is now something that we can all effectively and knowledgeably participate in. If all 800 of us in this class were to band together and protest for Santa Barbara to make changes, such as implementing better bike infrastructure, we could have some serious influence. That’s the power that this class has given us. It’s informed us of what needs to be changed and how we can bring about that change, as well as a community of peers who will be supportive in fighting in the battle for change. 

	<br><br>

Throughout these last nine weeks, this class has provided all of us with such a wide band of knowledge regarding the climate crisis and has exposed us to a multitude of resources and statistics that we can incorporate into climate discussions. As Ken has said in the past and repeated in this lecture, knowledge is only power when acted upon, otherwise, knowledge is power squandered. So let’s not let everything we’ve learned in this class go to waste. Whether you use this knowledge to educate others or to vote with the climate in mind or take part in movements and protests, just let it be a part of your life in some way. The climate crisis may be the biggest issue of our lifetimes and we can not afford to be complacent with this issue. Change needs to happen, and it needs to happen now.

I completely agree. Just because this class is ending does not mean that our drive for change can.  I think that everyone leaving this class has a lot of power in terms of what we have learned. We have the power to change our own lives, to influence those around us and inform them about the climate crisis, and to enact wider scale change. The aftermath of this class cannot be a return to the business as usual approach. We all have the power to take some action on some level and I think Ken has prepared us well. All of us know how to communicate climate change, we know how to act either individually, communally, or politically, and most of all we know how dire this situation is.
 	<br><br>

I am very happy that Ken decided to make this video that serves as a nice wrap up of the class. That way we do not need to comb through all of the other videos but rather we can watch and share this video that serves as a jumping off point for the other videos and other resources.
 	<br><br>

The time to act is now, so let's put our knowledge into action.

After listening to the twenty things that we could do to save the planet, I realized that it is not difficult. It wasn’t until the end that I realized, as Ken mentioned , that none of this requires technological innovation.This is great, because this comes to show that we could start acting now instead of waiting for technology to fix our issue. We are not even sure if technology will even help or how long it will take! These personal, cultural, economic, and political changes are all possible. Although we have all had the discussion that it is difficult for some to adapt to these changes, taking up even just some of these changes on a list makes a difference. I do believe that communicating the importance of this issue to others around us or receiving knowledge about the climate crisis plays a major role. With the recent elections, and being in this course, I dedicated my time to do my research about what the candidates had to offer not only to our society but our environment.

I completely agree with Brittney that saving the planet is not as hard as everyone makes it seem, rather it is just simple life adjustments.  In this lecture video Ken went over twenty ways in which individuals can make simple changes that dramatically influence the effects of climate change. I thought this lecture was very informational and a great recap of the quarter.

The ideas that stuck out with me on how I can personally change my climate footprint were way I eat, contraceptive, and biking. As a fairly active kid I am constantly watching what I eat but often with little thought on the impact of my food choices on my environment, but if I adapt a climitarian outlook on what I eat then I can be healthy and environmentally conscience. As a college student I am surrounded by people engaging in sexual intercourse and one of the most important ways to prevent diseases but more importantly a rise in populations is through the use of contraceptives. This is something that people and promote and help not over populate the earth. Then lastly as a kid who loves driving I realized this summer that I wanted physical activity and to not spend money on gas so I started riding my bike to work. Although I was not conscience about the climate change damage driving does but I learned that biking is easy and quite enjoyable.

<br><hr>
Yes, I agree with you. The keyword for the climate crisis is to act. We all need to act now. Also, in the lecture video “20 things that each of us can do to save the planet”, there are some things that are mentioned and emphasized before. First, food waste is a critical thing in order to reduce greenhouse gases. Since “Cowspiracy”, I’ve learned that it is extremely bad for us to waste food. If we buy the food we need and eat food all, there will be fewer greenhouse-gases emissions. Second, children planning in the family is also important. By educating more women and giving women more educational resources, there will be a good control over childbirth. At the same time, this is a win-and-win decision like professor Ken says. Women have equal writes as men as well as educational resources. Co-housing, micro-apartment, slow travel other than air travel, plant-based diet are all plausible solutions to reduce carbon emissions. I really thankful to professor Ken’s instruction which teaches us what is climate crisis and how can we do to face it.

"A boy and his father were walking through the woods together. They came across a large log, blocking their path. The boy turned to his father and said, “Do you think I can lift this log, Dad?” The father replied, “If you use all your strength, absolutely you can.” The boy rolled up his sleeves, bent his knees, and got his hands under the log. He locked his arms and heaved with every ounce of strength he had. But the log wouldn’t budge. He tried over and over again until at last, exhausted and breathless, he gave up.
 	<br><br>


He looked at his dad with disappointment and frustration and said, “You told me I could lift it!” His dad smiled and said gently, “I told you you could lift it if you used all your strength. You didn’t ask me for help.”
 	<br><br>


So the boy asked his dad to help him and together, they lifted the log out of their path.
 	<br><br>


Your strength isn’t held by you alone, but also by the people who march alongside you. When you feel unequal to the task in front of you, perhaps it is simply because you aren’t using all your strength."

 	<br><br>

If we as a species use all of our strength, we can most certainly fight this climate crisis. Vote for your fellow human friends who use love and compassion as their guiding principles in life who institute a change. Display kindness and happiness and when people ask how you live your life the way you do, or how you can be so happy all the time, be authentic and tell them how it isn't always easy- you've had many struggles already that you think none of your peers could relate to at such a young age in life. Find out that they too have had and currently have struggles, guilt, shame etc. The key to escaping the cycle of despair and negativity is living outside of yourself. Doing your part to save the environment, lifting others up when you can't lift up yourself. Change is possible, and change is coming.

I appreciate your story. As social animals, human beings have become the masters of the earth in a short period of time. We can see that if we can unite, the power we can exert is absolutely unimaginable. Unfortunately, with the stratification of human social classes, it is more and more difficult for all the people to “work” together. People are often selfish and hurt others, even the world, for their own desires. I hope that with the increase of intellectuals and the change in everyone's behavior, human beings can really work together to solve all environmental problems in the future.
 	<br><br>
Another thing I want to mention here and I’m not sure if it’s an egg. The end of the lecture ended abruptly. But if we turn on the subtitles, we can find that the last approach is “you", which is interesting.


<br><hr>

This was very inspiring. I also think a key component to fighting climate change is to live in a way where you are constantly helping others. The self-satisfaction will come naturally. If we stop thinking about ourselves all the time and focus more energy on others and others in the future, change will already be happening. Americans need to break this egotistical mindset and understand that it is not all about us. The rest of the world is just as important as America but unfortunately many fail to realize that. The things Ken listed that each of us can do to save the planet are completely doable. But as you said, we have to learn to live outside of ourselves to succeed.

<br><hr>
Your comment was particularly uplifting and hopeful. Usually, most comments discuss innovation and how they think we are going to solve climate change. However, the compassion that was outlined in your comment is a breath of fresh air. We, as human beings, need to use our compassion towards one another and the planet. 

 	<br><br>

We, as the citizens of the developed world, need to have compassion towards those in the developing world that are suffering from our contributions to climate change. Certainly, we have the funds and resources to accommodate not only ourselves, but also those that need help. Considering the fact that 3 billion people of the developing world have only emitted 5% of global greenhouse emissions and we, as a single country, have emitted 25%, it is our responsibility to reap the damages. Almost all of our "goods," ranging from clothing to kitchen appliances to vegetables, are made or grown someplace else. Because of our overconsumption, these third-world countries are suffering the most, while we continue to take flights and drive cars. 

 	<br><br>

We, as the citizens of the developed world, need to have compassion towards our earth. The earth provides many essential things for us, such as land, water, the air we breathe, etc. We need to cut back on what we eat, buy, and use. It is ridiculous that 40% of our land is used to feed livestock. Imagine if we used this land to build more co-housing establishments, which would not only provide inexpensive housing options, but it would also be a more efficient use of land. The earth gives us soil to grow our food, water to drink, and land to live on, yet we treat it so poorly in return. I'd be surprised if future generations would be still able to do all of these things with what there is left of the planet. 

 	<br><br>

I could go on and on about what we need to do, but Ken outlined 20 great ways that we can reduce our carbon footprint. We are the generation that will be affected by climate change, so we must take action immediately.

<br><hr>

I found this story to be a wonderful metaphor of the power that lies in collective effort. It shows that while the task of saving the planet may be daunting, if we all do our part and put in real work in helping make that change happen, then together we have a guarantee of achieving this goal. We all live together on this planet, and it is each of our responsibilities to take care of it and help others in doing the same. I like your point about living outside yourself, because its something that all of us need to take part in. We are so wrapped up in our own dramas that we end up creating more hardships and obstacles out of our ego-centrism. The solution, like you mention, is to step outside our small dramas and take steps to ground ourselves in something more meaningful, impactful, and fulfilling- like taking care of the Earth. Its time to dedicate our lives to committing small but powerful acts of selflessness, compassion, and mindfulness so that the generations to come can live in a better society than this one.


<br><hr>
This metaphor is really sweet and very good at showing off a key concept. We do all work better together. We need to ask for help when we need it and give it when we can. However, I'm not sure it's the best advice in fighting the climate crisis. Just tweeting Trump asking for his help in stopping the climate crisis will get you nowhere. We need to seize power. Vote in large numbers, campaign, fight for what you believe. I'm afraid that in this corrupt world, we won't get anywhere just asking.
 	<br><br>
Nothing wrong with a little civil disobedience, or even some less legal tactics. If it saves our planet, if it saves our children... It's the only morally acceptable thing to do. I've had a conversation with a friend in this class where she had a banana peel and asked if she could throw it in a bush. I told her: legally, no. Morally, it'll decompose and won't end up in a landfill, so yes. She threw the banana peel in the bush. The law is not always on the right side. It often isn't. Especially when it comes to the environment vs big corporations.
 	<br><br>
I hope you are right when you say change is coming. Because currently, the status quo will destroy the human race, and much of the Earth as well. It's terrifying and awful, but I suppose that means we must stand up for what is right.

<br><hr>
This story was very intriguing to read. My primary thoughts when I read about the theme of strength is that having the mental confidence to ask for help is also power in a different form. I think that most people tend to limit themselves a lot within the box like the boy in terms of trying to lift the wood purely by his physical strength alone. There must have been other available methods that the boy could have used, but he gave up because his continuous efforts in one thing would not work. People tend to psychologically invest in things that give them results back and when these results are slow they tend to opt out for things that will help their life prosper or become easier to live on. This same ideology can be applied to people and environmental changes as they become reluctant with the mindset that change is a hindrance to their lives. Ken recaps examples of changes we can take such as plant-based diets to expanding education and political voting. The moral of this story is to ultimately say that change does not need to be conquered alone as friends and family around you can help the transition of exchanges within one’s lifestyle as voting will help represent your spokesperson.


<br><hr>
I think this was a wonderful metaphor for the power of collective action. When facing the facts about climate change, the truth is that it is not something that will be achieved alone. By creating a social contract and working together, we can mitigate the effects of climate change. When I think about my individual role in all of this, sometimes there is a pervading sense of helplessness that comes from being alone. However, collective actions by multiple individuals will create the change that we want to see. We are not alone in this and the metaphor serves as an important reminder - this is a team effort. Everyone has to do their part and make changes, but it starts with yourself. That being said, we do have to have faith and encourage each other along the way because at the end of the day, success is dependent on our accountability to each other and to the planet. Societal change will take a huge amount of self awareness and will these 20 things we can do to make a difference, I'm sure that we will be able to implement at least a few of them in our daily lives.
<br><hr>
Thank you for sharing this story! It is absolutely true, the climate crisis is an issue that no one can singlehandedly fix on their own. Unless we can inspire everyone to collectively take action, I'm afraid we will continue down this dark path of self-destruction. But seeing how far the climate change reversal agenda has progressed and raised in popularity among both Americans and citizens of the world, I am very optimistic that we can create a sustainable future for ongoing generations to enjoy! But how do we start down this road to success? We have to educate, educate, educate! Videos like this help to easily condense all the strategies needed to help save the environment in an easy and understandable way which helps our cause greatly. I know that whenever I encounter someone curious about how they can help take part in building a better world, I will show them this video! The more people you educate, the more people they will then educate, thus increasing knowledge and awareness of the situation exponentially overtime. I am excited to see the progress we will make within the next 5 years~
<br><hr>
Reading your comment honestly warmed my heart. I think your anecdote really put things into perspective and emphasized the impact that working as a community can have. While we can make changes in our own lives to help the planet, it may not be enough. I agree with you, we need to vote for people, "humans, friends who use love and compassion as their guiding principles in life who institute a change." It was also cool to see it in this light after our past lectures. In the past few assignments, there was an emphasis on taking individual action to make a change and finding happiness through loved ones instead of materialistic things. Your comment really put things into perspective, especially how in order to really alleviate this climate crisis, we need to work together.

<br><hr>
I really like the metaphor that you used. I think it perfectly sums up the approach that we should be taking to this issue. People often don’t realize the strength of working together. A good analogy I like to use when explaining this to my friends and family is voting. If everybody says “my vote doesn’t matter”, then nobody will vote, and the candidate that someone wanted might lose because they decided not to vote. When you make an action it causes a ripple effect. For example, if I start saying a certain word, odds are that most of my friends will start saying too within a few weeks. It's no different with personal actions. As I have discussed in comments before, going vegan has encouraged those around me to do the same without any effort from myself. The saying “be the change you want to see in the world” is really cheesy but it's very very true. If we keep having the mindset that somebody out there is going to solve all of our problems, nothing is ever going to be done. We need to act now, not later. Putting off this issue is the worst thing we can possibly do. The 20 things that Ken described in the video are not insanely difficult changes. Every one of them can at least be attempted. I think the most important thing is for people to be more conscious of their eating habits. I think a lot of people would change what they eat if they knew the impacts that it has. In addition to this I think the health benefits of being vegan should be emphasized more, as sadly, that would get more people’s attention. Awareness and cooperation are the two most important things to use when trying to solve any large societal issue, and we need to do the same with the climate crisis. If it becomes more “trendy” to care about the environment, more people will follow the herd and do the same.
<br><hr>

I think that this quote you have is a perfect metaphor to how we need to deal with the climate crisis. If we only look at it in an individual scope it may seem impossible to solve and definitely discouraging. This problem is one that we are a human species created and one that we will need to fix as a whole. Although who contributed to it more may differ depending on where you live and your socioeconomic status, it is a problem that will affect everybody. We can't look to solve a crisis individually when it was a problem created over hundreds of years by millions of people. We need a systematic change that will require people to reconsider and change how they live.

I really enjoyed this video of Ken's. At first, I thought that it would be a very repetitive video of stuff we have already heard, and although it did repeat information, I thought the way Ken laid everything out and explained it was done in a manner that was comprehensive and purposeful. I appreciated that Ken not only touched on what personal actions we as individuals can take but what political and collective actions we can take as well. This video would be the perfect clip to show somebody when they ask "What can I do personally to help prevent further climate change?". In a short 20 minutes people can learn what lifestyle/cultural changes they can take to help save the planet and learn about the impact it will have on the environment, as well as the impact of their current actions. I think this video is a great tool rather than an hour and a half long documentary, this video is relatively short but very informative. I also think that this video is a great recap of English 23 as a whole and touched on all of the topics discussed in class.

I appreciated this lecture by Ken a lot as it was a recap of nearly all the possible actions we can do as a society to help combat the climate crisis. As this course is now coming to a close I have to be honest and say that I have truly come to understand all 20 of these possible actions. On that same note, I can also say truthfully that before taking this class I probably was informed about maybe three of them. Ken really laid out a solid foundation of topics in this class about what you can do as an individual and what you can do as a member of society to help make a true change. I am so thankful that I took this class being someone with little knowledge on such a life changing topic that needs to be dealt with sooner rather than later. This lecture was engaging to me because even though I knew all of it I was still able to follow along in a way that will stick with me for a long time. I enjoyed how Ken split the 20 topics up into two groups of 10 by what to do individually and politically. I liked this aspect of the video because they hold an equal amount of importance to our planet, but both need to be done to save our planet. There is a lot at stake when it comes to climate change and it is up to ourselves to begin to take affirmative action. This lecture was extremely easy to comprehend and is one that I know I will certainly be sending to friends and family. It is my wish that those who are close to me see this issue in the same light as I do and realize the urgency we must begin to have. Although this video did not go as in depth as we did in the ten weeks of this class, it was at least a really good summary condensed into 30 minutes. I know people have 30 minutes of time they can spare to watch this and I truly believe by doing so it will impact many. The worst that can happen if the climate crisis is a hoax is that by taking these 20 steps and incorporating them into your life, you live a happier and healthier life. It is important to understand what is wrong about a situation, but it is much more important to figure out how you can fix it. Ken lays out the plan of attack for us which I believe is the more so the hard part, we have the easy part by just following the instructions. Obviously, it is quite extreme to commit to all 20 of the given actions but you must start somewhere and plan on growing. Thanks to this class I am able to say I have been much more conscious about my carbon footprint and just in the span of 10 weeks have made pretty significant life changes. To put it into a better context I am not known to be one that loves change, but for something as critical as this I firmly believe change is the only way to save us. I plan on holding this information with me for the rest of my life and continue to live a life that is environmentally friendly.

I totally agree that this was a very fitting conclusion and summary of everything we have learned these past nine weeks. Like you, I was only aware of a handful of these 20 steps and definitely couldn't provide any in-depth examples or knowledge to anyone that might ask me about it. I believe one of the most important things we can do is educate others, which is why I truly admire Ken for everything he has done. Thanks to this class, I now feel confident to educate others on the climate crisis as well. I definitely wouldn't have gotten such a broad and versatile introduction to the environmental issues we face if I hadn't taken this course. Kind of funny that you can get college credit for a class that simply teaches you how not to destroy our planet. I really believe that everyone should be required to take a class like this and I am definitely planning on sharing these videos with my friends and family members. Like you said, everyone can spare 30 minutes of their free time to learn 20 effective and feasible ways to reduce their carbon footprint and mitigate our climate crisis.

I feel like this lecture video was a good way to summarize everything we have learned and discussed throughout this quarter. I know for many people in this class, including myself, it feels difficult to actually take steps to be more environmentally friendly. However, the stuff that Ken listed out is slowly doable. It is obvious that eating meat less or not at all will really help the environment. However, I realize that just because we switch to a plant-based diet does not mean that there are no more ways we can eat more environmentally friendly. I realized this with Ken’s example of us eating asparagus in the winter since there’s still a lot of CO2 that is being produced to fly it from South America.  It was shocking to hear that 103 gigatons of CO2 would be saved if we just make sure to educate boys and girls equally. I liked how Ken mentioned that it is a win-win situation because it moves us towards equality and helps save the planet. I personally am moving towards using a car less. Voting is very important and I am glad a lot more college students came out to vote this super tuesday.  I really like the sweet ending, being the change we want to see in the world. I am confident the change we want will come soon even if it is not right away.

I agree with you when you say that the things we have learned this quarter are enlightening but also seem hard to put into practice. Taking the steps to be more environmentally friendly means that we would have to abandon the way we currently carry out our lives. Your right that this is slowly doable but nonetheless it will take drastic change and determination on the part of activists and educators. We need to share the information we have received. I liked that you mentioned how environmentally costly it is to eat asparagus during the winter. I feel like many Americans don't even know where their food may come from or when it is in season. If Americans only bought local food that was in season I feel like we could really reduce emissions of harmful gases. I was also surprised when I realized how much of an impact educating everyone equally could have. I don't think anyone should have barriers to education especially if those barriers are also going to bar us from reaching global education about climate change. Unlike you, I am not fond of the idea of not using a car. I'm excited to get my license and have the capability of driving on my own. The convenience is desirable but at least now I understand the impact. I will have a moral obligation to use my car only when absolutely necessary. Perhaps I could use oil like Peter does to fuel his car. I'm open to alternative fuels. I was also very happy to vote in the primary on super tuesday.

I find it interesting how many of these problems can be approached through voting. So many issues from a local to global level can be effectively tackled by the voting process. I take this to be a testament to how quintessential the act of voting is. It is a central solution that may have the most lasting impact of any other type of political action. It is probably one of the most powerful things that a single person can do. I am so happy that this course places such a large emphasis on the act of voting and on being aware of our current political climate in general. Thank you so much for everything that you have done for us this quarter Ken. This lecture, like the many others before it, has truly enlightened by point of view. I am so glad to have been able to have been a part of this class. My actions and thought process have been permanently changed as a result of this class. Now, whenever I make a decision, I am careful to consider the impact of my actions from a environmentally friendly point of view. This class has truly changed my life and I am so appreciative for it.

Personally for me, I've never been into politics or anything and I never thought much about it, but after these nine weeks with Ken, he has opened my eyes to what our planet has become and how voting can definitely change how we're operating. As one of the most powerful countries, I believe that if we voted for the right things, our country will influence other countries to become better at reducing CO2 emissions and ultimately saving our planet.


<br><hr>
I agree with a lot of the points that you made throughout your comment. After the first weeks reading I was pessimistic that there was nothing that we could do to solve this problem that we have created due to our selfishness and consumerism. However, in the weeks that followed I learned that there were multiple ways in which we could help our planet. From switching over to a plant-based diet, and not using planes from getting place to place there are many ways in which you can reduce your carbon emission. One of the easiest and most effective things that we can do is vote. If we were to all go out to the polls and vote for someone that is determined to save our planet, we could get policies set in place that enforce reduction in carbon emissions. I believe that this was the most informative lecture out of the entire quarter and did a great job of informing the audience in under twenty-five minutes.

One of the best phrases I’ve heard regarding the climate crisis is “what if climate change really is a hoax and we create a better planet for no reason.” A better planet is all I envision when I think about a world with the changes that Ken says we need to implement. Caring more about the value of our food, eating plant based nutritious meals, giving women more access to birth control and education, having homes not cluttered by random useless stuff that we don’t really like anyways, buying well made items from people who are being treated with kindness and enjoy their work, and people voting and having meaningful conversations about progress in our communities all sounds pretty good to me! I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t like to live in a world like this, so why don’t we start living in it! This video, while wrapping up basically everything we’ve learned in this class, definitely made me the most optimistic about the future. By changing the ways that we live according to this video, not only are we creating a more environmentally conscious society, we are creating a better society in general, one that is more of an intertwined community. 
 	<br><br>

I have tried to implement many of these actions into my life, and I can honestly say that they make me so much happier! I have become much more appreciative of my food, my clothes, and my items knowing that they have an ethical background. I also feel more in touch with my community from buying locally instead of online. It has also been great to discuss with friends about topics such as the current elections. These changes have made me happier, and I am sure that if other people adopt these changes as well they will feel the same. I am very excited about the life that I believe our generation will create together, and I am grateful for people like Ken who are paving the way for us.

I agree that the changes recommended by this class have made me happier. Even the changes that were the hardest and seemed before as the most agonizing, are now joys to do. The hardest thing to change was my diet, which included cutting out beef. I gave myself an opportunity to do this for lent, and I feel great. Without beef, I am still getting the nutrition I need and I feel more energized then ever. Overall to build off what you were saying, I think we feel like we are better equipped to combat the climate crisis than before. We now know the facts and we know the steps that must be taken to accomplish significant change and save our planet. Like Ken it all starts with people addressing the issue. I believe we have a real shot at saving our planet, it all will come down to if we can make our voices heard and make people listen to what we have to say as the new generation.

<br><hr>
the fact that many people believe climate change is a hoax is quite shocking. 
 	<br><br>
What do we have to gain from restricting our use of fossil fuels? Or changing our diets? It would be much simpler to just maintain our fossil fuel addicted economy the way that it is. But we want to make a change, because we know with certainty that we have to. We know that 97-98 percent of scientists believe in anthropogenic climate change, and that we cannot continue to depend on fossil fuels and live lives dominated by consumerism.

It also wouldn’t be that restrictive to change our lifestyles, in fact, I think it would be better for all of us to eat healthier, and not live such sedentary lifestyles considering obesity levels in the United States. We wouldn’t only benefit physically from changing our lifestyles, but I think it would make us more connected to the earth and the people around us. 
 	<br><br>

I also try to be more mindful of my consumption, and it makes me more appreciative of the food I have. Before taking this class, I wouldn’t really think much when I threw away food, but now I see it’s value. I think about the farmers who picked my fruit. I think about the women in Bangladesh who made my clothes. I think about the water wasted because I wanted to eat a hamburger. This class has made me more mindful about how my individual contributions have an impact on the world. We call ourselves progressive in America, and say that we are “the land of the free” but our practices are completely unethical and harm those in the Global South. Our generation has to make changes in policies, we have no other choice. This is no longer a scientific issue, this is a social problem that severely needs a solution.
<br><hr>
Your point about creating a better planet with all these benefits to humanity despite a skeptic’s challenge like that is extremely significant in addressing the fight against climate change because it highlights that the goals and policies hoped to be enacted will definitely BENEFIT everyone while also PROTECTING our planet and its inhabitants. These suggestions highlighted by Ken admitting require a change of lifestyle for many but overall don’t negatively impact people in a way in which they can fully refute. What is important with these suggestions is enabling a smooth transition in which Americans of all classes can be supported by a fair, just system that will hopefully leave them better on the other side rather than worse, which is why it is important to communicate this once a thorough plan has been established.

I think Ken did a really good job outlining all the things you can do. This is just a small list though. I think a big one that he mentioned is voting. We are extremely lucky at ucsb that we have many polling stations so it doesn’t take that long to vote! Some colleges like ucla have ONE and it takes hours!! So a lot of people don’t go out and vote because they don’t want to wait in line. But doing this once every couple years like he said then it’s not that big of a deal. I think these are all amazing ideas though and everyone should see this video. Before this class I thought the only thing was to stop polluting the planet. I didn’t know you could save the planet by doing the little things such as use contraception or just being environmentally conscious (such as the asparagus comment)

Throughout the span of this class, we have been given A LOT of useful information. Ive learned a lot about what I can do to help fix the climate crisis and general knowledge on the climate crisis I can potentially use to educate others. I’m grateful that this video summed some of it up for me, since I don’t always remember everything. Even before this class, I would often times find myself thinking of my life in the future. I feel like this class really gave me a clearer picture of what I aspire my life to be like and how I can take steps towards it now. It all really starts with voting. As Ken emphasized in the video, it is a fast and huge way to make a difference. These upcoming elections can either be monumental for issues like the climate crisis or detrimental. Those of us who can vote NEED to go out and vote for those who can’t. Lives are in our hands. Americans who live in the U.S but are unable to vote. The lives of people around the world who are suffering the consequences of U.S.’ actions. Future generations whose lives and well-beings depend on our actions now. Its important we educate ourselves about the issues at hand. The news isn’t covering it and people aren’t seeing just how serious the issue actually is. Outside of voting, there are many other things we can all do to make a difference. Over ½ of the average Americans climate footprint comes from just their home and their car. The challenge is going to be changing the mindset that Americans have. We’re lucky to have the resources to better our public transportations systems and housing. We just have to invest in these solutions. As Ken said in the lecture, knowledge is only power when it is acted on. The facts and the evidence backing up climate change and potential solutions are all there. It’s time we act.

This is the best lecture I’ve seen through the quarter. Before taking this class, I really don’t understand much about the climate crisis. However, obtaining so much information and knowledge, I learned that our world can still survive if any one of us change our comfort lifestyles, abused use of cars, and reduction of air travel, our environment can definitely become a different one, and more importantly, a better one. We can do far more than only these 20 practices. It is our choice to make difference, and it is our thoughts that can be changed and adjusted. We are controlling and creating this living condition; not to mention, this circumstances. There is no way to blame others for emitting too much carbon emission; there is no way to say you are already changing but why not others. The environment is all being affected by us, humans. No matter how we bring out positive or negative impacts to our earth, we should take responsibility for our own results. Never too late to act, it is your choice to change.

The best part of all these solutions, especially the first 10, is that they don't reduce a person's quality of life or even impair their liberty much at all. If anything, they are all 'win-win-wins', and I think that's the best way to support these solutions. 'Saving the planet' to the vast majority of people is so abstract that they see no reason to attach themselves to more than one token climate healthy habit at a time. Maybe one month a person will do Meatless Mondays, then proceed to eat plenty of beef and out of season vegetables the rest of the days. Many people opt to buy a Tesla instead of considering or advocating for alternate forms of transport. Worst of all, many people our age talk about voting in candidates who care about the environment, but *don't actually vote*. The cultural change that Ken speaks of can't be influenced by abstract notions of an idyllic, environmentally conscious world, but instead the reality of what makes us happy: belonging and a strong sense of community. It's about doing what is intrinsically satisfying, or as the documentary 'Happy' puts it, being in a state of 'flow'. 
 	<br><br>


With this in mind, I'd like to form short arguments as to why the first 10 solutions to the climate crisis, personal actions, are satisfying in and of themselves. Eating a plant-based diet (or at least far less consumption of processed muscle meats as we often do) has been shown to improve several key factors of health, especially on the cardio side. As the documentary 'Game Changers' notes (though it's certainly not perfect, see James Cameron's conflict of interest), it can also improve performance when supplemented correctly for strength sports and entirely on its own for endurance athletics. Limiting food waste means appreciating every part of the plants and animals we consume, and the satisfaction in properly planning meals. When we eat foods in season, they are not only better for the environment, but taste a whole lot better. Having tomatoes in the winter should be a crime for anyone with taste buds! Using contraception allows couples to have more choice over when they're going to have children, which makes the couple and the children better off for it (it's best for married couples to wait 2+ years before having kids for good reason). Educating girls/women equally allows them equal opportunity in the job market and means they'll live more independent lives. As for biking, I've talked extensively as to why cars mean suffering and bikes make us happier. I'll just leave this article from Outside magazine, since it explains why bikes are better regardless of the environmental impact (https://www.outsideonline.com/2364371/stop-selling-bikes-environmentalism). Living mindfully means less space for mindless accumulation of worthless consumer goods, which leads nicely into the benefits of a minimalistic lifestyle. Minimalism makes us better appreciate what we have, which can apply to personal and material aspects of life. Slow travel, when possible, is far more satisfying than fast travel. It allows for one to appreciate all the places along to the way to your destination, and at least as a means of leisure can be far superior to an airplane. Finally, when we purchase well-made goods that treat workers fairly and repair them, the worker is of course better off. Repairing items can also be far more satisfying than just throwing them away. 

 	<br><br>

As you can see, solving the climate crisis needs to be put in terms of not only the relative importance of solutions, but making them attractive as well. I think this would lead to real change, instead of small, soon-to-be-forgotten token habits.

I am glad prefaced the video with this may be redundant, but I also believe this video served the purpose of wrapping everything together.  Breaking the list into two sections, personal actions and collective actions, made the information even more digestible. For these reasons, I decided to share this video on all of my social media platforms in the hopes that at least some would watch it (specifically those Uncle Pete’s in my family). Here is the list of things, in summarized forms, we can do to save the planet: 
 	<br><br>
1.Begins at markets and restaurants; buying just enough food and reducing food waste. Addressing food waste!
 	<br><br>
2.Meals; we eat for the good of the planet and its climate. Climatarian means more than veganism at times. Let's take the Asparagus in the winter example where importing it harms the planet more than eating meat at that point. 
 	<br><br>
3.Limit family size. Access to birth control and using it! 
 	<br><br>
4. In the classroom. Educating more women and girls. More education means less children. 103 gigatons is saved doing this. It's a win, win, win.
 	<br><br>
5. Public transportation. 
 	<br><br>
6.Co-housing or micro apartments.
 	<br><br>
7. Vacation; air-travel can double the size of footprint and is exclusive to the rich. 19 out of 20 do not fly. So try to limit flying and take longer trips. 
 	<br><br>
8. In stores and online, not buying new stuff
 	<br><br>
9. Borrow and repair items. Example in Being the Change where the community would come together and fix trinkets. 
 	<br><br>
10.Keep from buying from socially unjust practices like in the True Cost. Vote with our dollars and choices. 
 	<br><br>
11.Cast votes for candidates who support carbon taxing and the green new deal. Vote to stop fracking.
 	<br><br>
12. Put people and planet ahead of corporates. Think more broadly! Ex, the beef industry and its cause of habitat loss, waste removal, herbicides, pesticides, etc. 
 	<br><br>
13. Communicating to friends and family; intergenerational teaching. 
 	<br><br>
14. Collaborating and activism; ex, Denmark and fighting for bike lanes!
 	<br><br>
15. Protesting and civil disobedience.
 	<br><br>
16. Reading and learning more about the climate crisis. 
 	<br><br>
17. Rethinking how we inhabit this planet. We need to change the way we live. Tech alone will not do this.
 	<br><br>
18.sharing what we know. Knowledge is only power if acted upon. 
 	<br><br>
19.Joining others to support each other. Emotional support.
 	<br><br>
20. With us.
 	<br><br>


Hopefully if we practice all of this, then we will see a change.

I enjoyed this lecture snippet a lot as it summarizes the actions and how they are related to the readings that we have done.  There is a lot of things on the list I haven't done, but I would like to do them starting now. I appreciate what I've learned throughout these 10 weeks, I'm going to take all that I learned and try to apply it to my daily life. I'm going to make wise food choices, make conversations with people around me, become a climate activism, and  make better alternative plans to car/flying travels. My action might seem very small, but I believe my actions can make impact, small impacts if not huge

I also enjoyed this week’s lecture and I have to say this is by far my favorite video that Ken has posted. By summarizing what we have learned throughout this course, it makes it easy to see that we, as individuals, can bring about change. The 20 things that Ken lists that each of us can do to save the planet is really inspiring as well as enlightening. After weeks of reading about how our planet is doomed and how nothing is being done, it is really motivating to see that change can happen. Change starts with us. Everything is in our hands and it is up to us to decide if we want to change how we live. We can make the decision to change our lifestyle, lower our impacts, and help save our planet or continue to let things be the way they are now. 

 	<br><br>

As this class comes to a close, I have definitely learned a lot about what I can do to help make the planet a better place. I will be more conscientious about my lifestyle choices such as, eating less beef and moving towards a plant-based diet, flying less by finding alternative means of travel, and reducing the amount I spend on goods that I don’t need. However, the most important thing I can do, and will be doing, is to continue voting for officials that care about the environment and will pass policies that protect our planet, not harm it. Like you’ve mentioned, our individual actions might be small and seem insignificant, but if all of us were to even partake in even half of these suggestions, we can cut down our emissions tremendously.

One solution I have been continuously thinking about was #16: education. Of course I knew that the climate was changing in high school, but I didn’t know the full extent of the causes, the urgency, or the severity until I came to UCSB. Education is so important to sparking change, and it is especially important to be educating high schoolers, my generation, because we are the ones who will have to face the climate crisis the most. I would’ve started changing my actions years ago if only I had been informed by my high school teachers about the climate crisis. Sadly, I never was and also didn’t have the opportunity to take an environmental science class. If all high schools across the nation were required to teach students about the climate crisis as a graduation requirement and learn the solutions presented in this video, I think my generation would become more politically active and willing to change individual actions.

I've been thinking about education for years, and I agree with you! I have thought so many times about how classes like this one should be required as early on as elementary or middle school. Unlike you, I took an environmental science class, but climate change was grossly underrepresented.  
 	<br><br>

It's so hard to make people change their minds. I feel that recently, there has been a focus on being open-minded and unbiased, but I feel that education should have been focused on making people more adaptable and open to change. People are comfortable when they know what will happen. In communication, there is a theory on schemas. Schemas are mental stuctures that we organize information with. They are meant to help you understand how things work. When you recognize one part of a schema, you'll remember the rest of it and know how to act. For example, you'd know the procedure of going to a doctor's appointment or the road you take to get to Campbell Hall. Schemas are great because they help you process information, but they can make you think more passively. Biking to Campbell Hall might become automatic, and you might crash if something changes because you're not actively processing information. You might not notice if something's wrong because it's normal to you or you might not remember specific details because you're not really thinking. 
 	<br><br>

When things change, issues happen because people don't usually expect the the change and don't react well or at all. For example, you might not notice a repeated word if you're skimming. I remember someone saying something along the lines of having daily schedules posted made students more comfortable because the students knew what was coming up. I feel that instead of catering to people's desire for familiarity and stability, the education system should teach students to become more accepting of change and focus on flexibility. I admire people who are creative because I feel that it's hard to make anything new or do something out of the box. We like stability because it lowers the chances of error, but, in some cases, some spontaneity should be appreciated. Being responsible and consistent is admired, but being able to adapt and react is highly important, as seen by various videos praising celebrities for adapting well to sudden changes and unexpected mistakes. Lastly, instead of skimming information, people need to critically evaluate what they read. Even if you trust the source, you shouldn't relax because people can make mistakes or accidentally be biased. 
 	<br><br>

If we had been taught to be flexible and willing to change from a young age, instead of getting used to schedules and structured systems, then perhaps this video or class wouldn't need to exist. The list would be easy. These changes wouldn't be difficult, but they are because people aren't truly willing to change because they're taught that change is scary.

This lecture given to us by Ken does a great job at summarizing all the points that have been made throughout the course. As Ken mentions, if there is one video out of the whole course that you want to share with your friends this should be the one. It tells you all the things that we must do in order to combat climate change. This lecture reminded me of the beginning of the course when someone made a comment about wanting to hear all the solutions already instead of listening to Ken apologize for his generation. I’m sure that person is very content now. Of course all 20 solutions are extremely important, and they should all be followed, but there is one that really speaks to us. The solution I am referring to is number 20. This solution advises us to be the change we want to see in the world, and that makes this solution really stand out. By following this one you will be motivated to follow the rest.

I like how Professor Hiltner broke down his 20 things about the climate crisis into 20 things, 10 of which focus on individual actions we can take, and 10 other things are political and collective action, because as we do in As we learned earlier in the quarter, we need these types of actions in these three areas to achieve environmental change. I think an important issue to pay attention to is that the solution to the climate crisis is not a quick and easy solution. It requires multiple changes over a long period of time. If we want it to have a significant impact, then large companies need to follow these steps. Mainly because these two actions have different practical solutions. For example, collective action is more bureaucratic and often difficult to implement. However, once collective action has been taken, it can prove to have a huge positive impact and often leads to widespread widespread. For example, one of the proposed solutions is to restrict flying. As mentioned above, a large amount of bureaucracy is involved, which makes it almost impossible to restrict flights. This is due to the significant contribution that flying has made to the global economy. Businessmen, artists, athletes, and politicians all rely heavily on air travel, so flying is essential for these people. In addition, international trade in goods will be severely distorted by flight restrictions, which will cost businesses and countries a lot of money. It summarizes the main points of the classroom and will enable prospective students and audiences outside the classroom to quickly understand how to change lifestyles in response to climate change. It depends on what you can do, which will affect the climate a few years from now.

<p>

I think this lecture is genius. Because yes, governments will need to take action, but we as individuals want to know what we can do. This lecture provides a host of solutions and steps we could take.
 	<br><br>

I’d like to, for a moment, go more into the philosophy of human beings. I believe they are fundamentally good. I believe that they can be corrupted by greed, hunger, or ignorance, that cannot be denied. But, I think that if you believe positive change can be made in the world, you must believe that people are basically good on pain of irrationality.
 	<br><br>

When you give people the chance to do good, meaning making them aware to the problem, giving them the tools to solve it without a major detriment to their own lives, and providing a framework with which to act, they will pursue the moral action. This lecture helps fill in one of those pieces. The problem is well defined, and now is the solution. We just need to create a setting in which all this knowledge can be acted upon.




</p><hr>


<p>
This lecture video sums up 20 ways, political or individual, that each one of us can take or participate to combat climate change. It is obvious that all three actions, whether it is individual, collective or political, are needed to really fight climate change. For people who are already aware of the dire situation, this video serves as a good reminder and summary for our future actions, a checklist to make sure that we can slowly transition ourselves to complete. For people who are interested in taking an action but unsure what to do, this video will be the video to watch. It is sad that most of these things should have been our survival common sense, like not wasting stuff, exercise your right to vote, forming bonds with other people, etc., but consumerism culture has stripped all of these instincts away from us, turned us into a machine hungry for money and power.
  	<br><br>
  We are almost at the conclusion of this course, and I suppose this video does leave me with hope, just like Ken said at the beginning of the class. Climate crisis is a big issue, and it involves many aspects of our lives, but that comes with many solutions. Maybe some of them are not currently achievable for you, but I am sure the everyone can start doing something that is listed in the video. For me, cutting down food waste, reducing my travel and buying less will be my first step towards sustainability. A small step, but worth something at the very least.

That's probably the best thing this video does: outline twenty things that can be done, many of which overlap. This probably still isn't my absolute favorite video, but it's up there.



</span></div><hr>


<p>

Finally, a structured and clear list of what we individually can do to counteract climate change outlining this whole course. All these things are not crazy or unrealistic in my opinion. Not every thing has to be followed religiously, but if people made choices with these things in mind we could all cut down carbon emissions significantly. I think one thing on the list that many people overlook when thinking about how they can make a difference is birth control. Accessible and free contraception is HUGE and something this country needs. People are going to have sex no matter what, and why can't we provide ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies. On top of this, why would we try to ban abortion? For those unwanted pregnancies, if every single woman was forced to give birth to her child, we would not only suffer from overpopulation but those children that resulted from unwanted pregnancies are likely to enter the foster care system or live rough lives because their mother and/or her partner were never prepared for a baby in the first place. This of course ties into other things on the list such as voting for candidates with sweeping climate action plans. Sadly, so much of the support behind this change is torn down by the right and religious people. I was baffled last year when abortion laws in some southern states changed to make them nearly impossible to get for a woman, even if she was raped. However, I know this cannot be the ideals of the entire right. I feel this belief that birth control is a problem or dangerous to society is an outdated belief that is slowly dying out, as many young people disagree despite their political affiliation.

For this comment, I am going to summarize the twenty things we can individually do to save the planet, and respond to each of them regarding how I am either already doing that thing, or how I am planning on becoming more involved with it. But before I do this, I would like to say thank you to Ken for providing such a concise informational video that I can send to curious friends and family!
 	<br><br>

1) BUY ENOUGH TO EAT AND NO MORE. I practice veganism, and I am dabbling in freeganism. For example, I roasted carrots the other night, and I made a pesto from the carrot tops that went with the dish.
 	<br><br>
2) EAT FOR THE GOOD OF THE PLANET AND ITS CLIMATE. When I have the money, I do my very best to shop local, like at the food co-op here in Isla Vista. I am still learning when the best seasons to eat some vegetables are.
 	<br><br>
3) USE CONTRACEPTIVES AND LIMIT FAMILY SIZE. I am not planning on having my own kids (I would rather adopt), but if I decide to, I would have no more than two to replace my partner and I.
 	<br><br>
4) FAIRLY AND EQUALLY EDUCATE BOYS AND GIRLS. I will always vote for candidates that strive to do this in the US, and I am curious as to how I can support actions like this in less educated countries.
 	<br><br>
5) WALK, BIKE, OR TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORT. Well, I live in Isla Vista, which means I own a bike and I do not own a car. Lets see how long I can keep this up. When I get graduate and move in with my partner, we plan to share a vehicle and a scooter (like a Vespa). I am curious as to how I can transition those vehicles so they run on vegetable oil.
 	<br><br>
6) LIVE IN APPROPRIATELY SIZED HOUSING. As I mentioned in an earlier comment, I already live in a co-op! There is a co-op system right here in Isla Vista, and barely anyone knows about it. Visit sbcoop.org for more info :)
 	<br><br>
7) SLOW TRAVEL IS BETTER THAN AIR TRAVEL. Aside from the one trip I have planned with my family, I am not planning on flying unless it is a big vacation every five years. Us members of Gen Y and Z are too broke to afford to travel anyway lol.
 	<br><br>
8) DON'T BUY UNNECESSARY STUFF. I love clothing, but I already thrift basically everything I own (except for underwear). And I try to keep my closet small because I move so much between school and home. I've learned that minimalism is handy!
 	<br><br>
9) BORROW, RENT OR EXCHANGE. This is easy for me since I live in a co-op! We have a lot of community items like tools and cleaning supplies, and if we need maybe an ingredient for a dish we are making, we can just ask the group chat. Everybody shares!
 	<br><br>
10) BUY SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS. I work towards this when I buy things secondhand. When I have to buy toiletry products like body wash, I make sure it is a cruelty free product. I will put more time towards checking the ingredients to make sure they are environmentally friendly (ex. no palm oil) and eventually transition to zero-waste products like shampoo bars.
 	<br><br>
11) VOTE FOR CANDIDATES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PLANS. I already do this.
 	<br><br>
12) " THAT PUT PEOPLE AND THE PLANET AHEAD OF CORPORATE INTEREST. I do this.
 	<br><br>
13) TELL YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY TO VOTE. I do this too!
 	<br><br>
14) GATHER AND JOIN PLACES FOR CLIMATE ACTIVISM. My roommate is a big activist. I will ask her for info on events.
 	<br><br>
15) PROTEST + ACTS OF CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. I will stay connected with the environmentalist community.
 	<br><br>
16) READ + EDUCATE YOURSELF ABOUT THE CRISIS. Reading is very hard for me because of a brain injury I had five years ago. Documentaries and short YouTube videos are the easiest way for me to absorb information.
 	<br><br>
17) RETHINK HOW WE INHABIT THIS PLANET. I am improving my actions daily!
 	<br><br>
18) SHARE WHAT WE KNOW WITH OUR FRIENDS. I just sent this video to my family.
 	<br><br>
19) JOIN WITH OTHERS FOR SUPPORT IN YOUR JOURNEY + ACTIONS. I have many vegan friends! I must introduce them to freeganism.
 	<br><br>
20) "BECOME THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE IN THE WORLD" - Gandhi

I Really appreciate how you respond to each of the things in the list. Every one of us in the class should be like you after taking the class as we’ve aware of the seriousness of the climate crisis and the importance of taking actions now to protect the earth. These twenty things are so small that all of us could easily live up to it. We should share this list to our family as well. I like the last one the most, which is Gandhis’ words. “become the change you want to see in the world”. I’ll now be the change I want to see too.

I am very glad the assignments throughout this class have gotten more and more positive! I will definitely write down these 20 points and hang them up somewhere in my room or apartment. Since this class has started, I can honestly say I wasn’t expecting it to make a huge impact on me, but it did. As someone who used to think they could never give up meat, I’ve decided to slowly start cutting meat out of my diet, starting with beef and then making my way to pork and then chicken. It will be very hard since a lot of my cultural dishes involve those three, but I really want to make a change. The other solutions I have already been implementing into my lifestyle such as not driving or flying, limiting food waste, thrifting and not buying into fast fashion, and co-housing. I plan to start incorporating minimalism in my life soon as well. 
 	<br><br>
I also really appreciate highlighting how important being politically active is, politics affects everyone! Voting for candidates who believe and want to work to fight climate change is super important! Although we can spread awareness through social media and protesting, it will help a lot to have someone in a government position to power our demands forward. 
 	<br><br>
Most importantly, I think changing our mindset is one everyone should learn more about. Why is it so hard to live in a smaller house or choose slow travel or give up meat? We’ll be unhappy about it? Change your mindset! Living in a smaller house greatly and positively impacts our environment, as well as giving up meat. Of course, this cannot apply to everyone since there are people who are disadvantaged financially as well as other ways. But I hope soon in the future, eco-friendly transportation among other things become more affordable to all, that way no one has an excuse to not make some type of change.

Every practice and solution should not be unrealistic. I believe everything you mentioned is important and should not be forgotten.

I really enjoy watching this lecture video, because Ken not only summarized pretty much everything we mentioned in previous episodes but also provided us with brand-new ideas towards how to fight as an environmental activist. The first ten ways that Ken has mentioned have all showed up in previous lecture videos. These are ten practical ways that we can do on our own, as individuals, to protect our shared planet. Then the newly appeared ten ways are more about what we can together do to make a huge difference. I do notice that voting the right candidate who stands for protecting our Earth is the most crucial part. As Ken mentioned, we can do a lot on our own, but we still need the government to do big changes by enacting new green standard laws and regulations. Also another big part is effective communication. In the last week’s lecture video, Ken taught us all how to tell other what we are fighting for. We can actually apply that to real life. We can teach our friends our knowledge upon the climate crisis. If each one of us in this course could do this to five people, then together we’ve already contributed a lot. Of course, emotional support for each other is also significant. Therefore, Let’s get what we want together!

I agree that this lecture video provided by Ken summarizes the key points we have learned in this class so far. These individual choices we can make to better protect our planet are laid out and said to make a difference. A lot of the time, the world seems so large and this makes your own actions feel insignificant. I agree that this video does a really good job of not only reminding what healthy and productive individualistic choices are, but also encouraging that they really do matter and make a difference during this crisis. For change to happen, the individual choices of many must be made using mindfulness and keeping respect for the planet in mind. Some choices that could be made for example would be to make smart decisions when it comes to how you consume food such as wasting less or consuming less meat. Another choice could be to travel in more fuel efficient ways.  
  	<br><br>

I agree that something so great about this video also was that not just main key points were summarized for individual change, but also importance is placed on how voting and rooting for those who stand for revolutionary environmental change is a crucial part of protecting our environment. Civic engagement is so important if we are going to make change. If we are going to start a movement of change, our voices need to be heard so it is so important to stand with someone who represents your beliefs and stands for the change that you want to see in the world.

Ken, I agree with you about all your suggestions and appeals to personal, collective solutions as well as all the quotations you have referred to during this course. However, I can't agree with you when you shape the story of Greta Thunberg as one excellent example of understanding and acting on the climate issue, especially at a young age. As I see, the climate crisis is not a black-and-white issue. However, it is way more than that. The most important lesson to younger generations, to my concern, is to educate them about this fact which is complicated under social, environmental, and cultural reasons. As we are talking about solving the climate crisis, we have to pay attention to the fact that this complicated issue can't be simply solved by criticizing the government and inciting anyone. The fact now is that we don't have the technology in hand to solve everything terrible; otherwise, we won't be here talking about solutions but we will act on it already. I know this is staggering and sad to me, but we have to take it. We need to understand that there is no one to blame on and we have to act, starting with personal and collective actions as well as accepting this complex issue.

Before I took this class, I was very indifferent about the climate crisis. I was very ignorant of the problem because it did not impact my immediate life. I was wrong-- the climate crisis impacts my life in many ways. It is selfish to think that just because it is not visible, the climate crisis problem is not affecting the lives of millions of people. My point of view came from a place of privilege, and I now recognize how many people are under the same ignorant impression throughout the nation. I wish I could force every single person in this nation to take this class, because if that happened, then we are one step closer to mitigating the climate crisis. The world would be much more knowledgable and willing to take action in their individual lives. Sure, some solutions to mitigating the climate crisis are extreme, but the individual changes you could make to your immediate life are simplistic enough to implement. Simply reducing your food waste, being politically active, composting, and biking instead of taking the car could go a long way. People need to realize that these simple changes go a long way and that it's not impossible to do your part in saving the planet. Ken has proposed many solutions that are realistic for anyone to follow, and like Ghandi said, "Be the change you wish to see in the world."

Honestly, I wholeheartedly agree with your comment. I too felt like the climate crisis did not really mean much to me as it did not effect my personal lives, however I now know how selfish and idiotic I was. This crisis IS affecting the lives of everyone on this earth, including those who did not contribute to the detrimental lifestyles that most Americans have today. Going off what you said about making every single person in the nation to take this class, I can not agree more. We should add at least a small portion of this class to high school curriculum so these young adults, who are still learning their place in the world, can learn. I feel like this would help future generations understand effect to not only the friends around them, but also the lives of their kids, grand kids, etc. We need to start educating more of the public TODAY.

I really enjoyed Ken's lecture video this week because it was a great recap of all of the information we have learned in this course this quarter and it motivated me to educate others on the current fate of our climate and how we can resolve these issues and preserve the human legacy on earth. He reinforces how easy it is to make a difference for the planet and how everyone can create change. This made me much more hopeful for the future and confident in the fact that as an individual I can make changes to my personal lifestyle that will aid in reversing the effects of climate change. Some suggestions that he encourages are eating as a climatarian, educating women, family planning/ sex education, cohousing, voting, and attempting to live minimally. Things that he discourages are our reliance on technology, air and car travel, and remaining ignorant to the inevitable repercussions coming if we do not act now. 
  	<br><br>
As Ken encapsulates all of the knowledge we have gained in this course he incorporates how we should continue to spread this knowledge since so many individuals around the world are unaware of the true and present effects of climate change on the earth produced by humans. We should relay our knowledge through effective communication tailored to our audience and supported by scientific evidence. We should also purposefully lead by example by first making as many of these changes in our personal lives, as well. I am very optimistic for our generation and its ability to be the ones to save the planet.

this was a great summary or recap on the many sub-issues that climate change needs us to focus on and a good array of solutions that we can help be a part of. I too have been motivated enough throughout this quarter to talk more about the issues revolving our environment and have found myself at time unintentionally bringing awareness to these problems in everyday settings. I’m glad Ken takes a positive perspective on how it is we can start inciting change through our actions and am personally very interested in altering some of my own habits. Personally, I have decided to alter my diet, while Im not likely to become a full vegan, I do plan to cut out meat and other foods that simply don’t align with the well being of our planet. Going on for weeks as to how much food waste, agriculture/production and water goes into us being able to fix up a meal, it no longer makes sense for me to continue dietary habits I know are not great for me and also not ideal for our earth. I am definitely glad with the information I am taking away from this class it came to a huge surprise to learn about all the aspects that play a direct role in harming our planet. Issues like sex education and equal (womens) educational opportunities are social problems I wouldn’t have before considered climate related. In general I agree with all of the comments I have read this far, relaying our knowledge can only have a positive impact. Using what we learned in this class to bring attention to a global issue many are uncomfortable or deny talking about is sort of our job as students.
<br><hr>
I loved reading your comment on this week's lecture video, "Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet". I agree that this video was a great recap of the course and that I was the perfect way to finish the journey each of us has taken when we joined this course. I second that Ken has done a great job of reinforcing how simple it actually can be to contribute change to our planet and to be an active communicator of the climate crisis. As tomorrow is voting day, watching this video reminded me of why I am going to cast my vote and just how important it is to voice our concerns about where our planet is heading. All of the things we have learned along the way and the suggestions Ken has made to reduce our carbon footprint solidified my choice and I am looking forward to tomorrow.
  	<br><br>
I think the thing that resonated with me the most this week, is when Ken said that "the phrase saving the planet almost always implies that we are saving it for ourselves: humanity," and that what the phrase leaves unsaid is that the planet includes all life on it. I think people tend to forget just how much the climate crisis is affecting; our oceans, our wildlife, the population today, and the generations to come. It is much more than a current political issue and unfortunately, our media today is turning it into exactly that. Being retold about the many solutions and personal actions we can make, such as eating as a climatarian, attempting to live minimally, voting, and utilizing public transportation instead of cars and planes, was a great reminder of how capable my generation is of making a difference. I too am optimistic and hopeful we can step up to be the ones to save the planet. The next step, after completing this course, is to take the knowledge we have accumulated and put it into action.

<br><hr>
I totally agree! This video mirrors the "Top 25 Ways to Help the Environment" video from a couple weeks back. With these summaries, I find that I can definitely identify with some of these actions, and can definitely incorporate more into my current lifestyle. These types of lists make information about the climate/ways we can help the climate much more accessible and easy to understand. I admired Ken's point that educating students to be able to sift through the crap and real information is invariably important because I feel like that is a skill I still lack. Most of the items on this list are easily attainable, and give me hope for the future as well! As Ken stresses, some of the most important things we can do for the climate (voting and sharing these lists) are so simple and easily done. If these massively help, then we can easily turn the tide :)
  	<br><br>


I do think I will have trouble reducing air and car travel,  but I will definitely do my best and at the very least, be more mindful about it. My meat habits have already changed, and I've started to reject buying new clothes-  choosing instead to look at online thrift stores or on UCSB Free and For Sale! There are so many easy changes as well.  I think this video, compiled with the top 25 list, and the reading on communication, we can become a very powerful set of activists, and help our climate. It starts with us! I'm honestly going to take a lot away from this course, and I am so happy I signed up. I am so optimistic and ready to make change! 
  	<br><br>


Overall, I think there is hope for us. With the election results pending from "Super Tuesday", it is so important that we unite to make a change in government, and elect people who listen to us and help fix our dying climate. Let's hope it all went well!! :)





</span></div><hr>


<p>
Within the solutions, there were calls to all sorts of actions. In this comment, I would like to focus on collective and political action.
  	<br><br>

Even in my Political Science class, we discussed international cooperation over climate change and in that conversation, we concluded that voting is the most important thing to do. It’s a bit odd because you’d think that personal action would be since it’s more concrete than the social construct of voting, but we are in a social contract between the government and they can enforce collective action and lead to results better than the willing can. It’s important to recognize that voting is essentially only one to two hours per year. Change starts in the voting place. Ken said it himself that if you do not have time or dedication for the first ten personal actions that he listed, the most important act that you can do is to simply vote for the right people. 
  	<br><br>

This means voting for candidates who advocate for sweeping climate policies. These candidates prioritize climate change and consider it a serious, time-sensitive issue. With them in power, it then comes time to vote for environmental initiatives. Voting is important from the local to the national level. These are the figures that can make laws in your local city to across the nation. I remember in class someone emphasized the importance of local officials. They can decide things, such as how roads are constructed. This would be a topic of concern because to promote bicyclism, you would want bike lanes to exist safely. With enough demand, your city could even adopt a new structure from the lanes, car parking, and the bike lane to the far right (protected from passing traffic by the parked cars). Another example would be how in Santa Barbara elections were happening not too long ago and Bruce Portman and Joan Hartmann would attack each other, blaming the other for not caring about the environment. In this case, it would be important to vote for the one with a history of climate activism and a platform to protect the environment.
  	<br><br>

Relating to that, take time to educate yourself. Take time to research politicians running and who has the most eco-friendly platform. And on top of that, take a long look at how we inhabit this planet. Notice how we live our lives. If we will successfully survive this, we will need to change everything. It is foolish and dangerous to rely on technology alone to overturn climate crisis because it is our mass consumerism and culture of our lifestyle that led to this climate change and what needs to be altered. I urge you, and myself, to get educated even beyond this course and then tell people about the climate crisis, explaining the solutions for them to adopt and the importance of voting. When you are educated, you can sway skeptics and appear credible. This may gather and create powerful groups who are activists and policy-makers. You can go even further and have your voice heard outside of a ballot. Protest and take power away from the opposition! This can stir more education and more attention, guiding people to learn more of the situation and voting for the green side.
  	<br><br>

I think the most important reminder yet is to lead by example. This connects all the acts together by simply saying do all these things. Anyone can do it. Remember that Greta Thunberg was a pretty average high school student who completely turned her life around. She became vegan, gave up flying, and challenged her parents to lower their carbon footprint. Through her leadership, she has educated and inspired others. Follow her example and lead by example! Challenge yourself and others to make a change in their life for the betterment of our earth. Follow these tips.

I really appreciated how comprehensive this list was. Most of it was repetitive, as I have been in class for nine weeks now and also took English 23. But, I still enjoyed hearing everything again and knowing that this comprehensive list exists on the internet for the world to see. I particularly appreciated the part where Ken emphasis a woman’s RIGHT to be in control of her own body. I obviously, being a woman, care very much about this as it directly pertains to me, but it should be on everyone's list of priorities. It's a basic human right to be in charge of your body and a woman's choice to have or not have a child can potentially impact the rest of the world and be an important step in combating the climate crisis. I also appreciated the aspect of voting. It is so crucial that we as young people take control of our future and mobilize the young vote. I don't know about you guys, but I’m tired of the generation that caused a majority of the climate crisis remaining control. It is our turn. We know what we have to do and we have to be ready to do it. If it is something as simple as voting, we have absolutely no excuse. Obviously, the next step is to become more directly involved in government, but for now, we have to cast our ballots because our voices do matter. This was a great week nine video because it truly does put it all together. This video wraps what we have covered in the course (in terms of what we can each do) up in a very effective manner.

I completely agree with your message, especially when you mentioned the right of women to take control of their reproductive system. Women all over the world should have the human right to decide whether or not she wants to become a mother. However, unfortunately, this is not the current reality of the situation. Women in developing countries lack access to birth contraceptives that we in first world countries have available anywhere we go. Due to the lack of birth control as well as the traditional culture women from these developing countries do become mothers to many children; thereby increasing the total population. It is incredible to believe that we are currently at seven billion people and once we come close to and get to ten billion people, it is expected to have large consequences because, in reality, the planet can not sustain a population of ten billion. If we as of right now, at a mark of seven billion, we are destroying the planet, I don't want to know what the magnitude ten billion people can have on the planet. It is rather scary if you ask me.

In this lecture, Ken’s gave out 20 of the very direct and comprehensive solutions for us or the government to take to fight against the climate crisis. I think it’s like a summary of all the lecture. Ken make it more understandable by separating those solutions into two parts. One focus on personal actions and the other one focus on political action. Ken’ s words also make me feel positive about the climate change as it make me more clear about what exactly we can do to contribute to the climate change and it’s effective. I think one of the things that i need to change for myself is my eating style. I am still in favor of eating more meat in a meal and getting much food even thought i can’t finish all of it. But after taking this class and having a deep knowledge about climate change, i started realizing that my eating habit actually causes a stress on CO2 emission. Although it won’t make an observable difference on climate change, it will still cause indirect impact since there may be many other person think taking action to be useless. It’s impossible for me to completely finish the shift on my eating habit right away, but i am still working on it and i will encourage my friends meanwhile.

I agree with you, this last lecture video felt like a summary of all the lectures since the beginning of the quarter combined. I like that he gave us like 10 political actions and 10 actions that had to come from us, individually. His last youtube video for the quarter gave me a more optimistic outlook for our planet. I was left with the belief that there might be hope for us if we implement some of these actions as soon as possible. If people took more time out of their days to educate themselves on the issues in the world coming from climate change, I think people would try to change their lifestyles even if it is with something small. Another thing is that if our presidential election goes the correct way, I know for a fact there will be more stricter laws that would reduce the effects coming from climate change. I'm glad I chose to take this class and can only go on to share my new knowledge with my friends and family.

For me, the most important part is just to educate boys and girls equally. Everyone is equal when they are born. Everyone have the right to choose whatever they want to be and what they want to do. as the same as girls’ education. All people should educate organized because only high education can help people to realize the importance of our limited resources and environment. Only by that, our next generation will have a humble and positive mind to accept the disaster that will happen to them and fix the environmental problem efficiently. After all, I really appreciate the recap and wish everyone has a wonderful final.

As pointed out by Ken multiple times throughout the course and in this lecture video, technological innovation is not going to be the panacea that cures the plague of the climate crisis. People that are uninformed of the issue often think that they can drastically reduce their carbon footprint by switching over to an electric car, therefore they have fulfilled their part. Educating these types of people should be one of our core focuses if we are to seek a proper solution to the issue. People that are introducing this narrative that climate change is a hoax prey on the uneducated because they are the easiest to pollute. I know many people in my life that are simply unaware of the facts, or only have a partial clue as to what the climate crisis really is, yet we all participate in a society that heavily emits greenhouse gases and pollutes the environment. I myself did not even have anything beyond a vague idea of the issue at hand before coming to UCSB, which is concerning because learning about the issue is not mandatory, despite the serious implications it has for humanity as a whole. We should all try our best to inform the people around us, so that we all can stop being complacent and actually take action.

I definitely agree with your point, education is the key to stopping climate crisis. We cannot keep pushing for changes in regulations on a grander scale and lifestyle changes on a personal basis if we do not educate others on why we must change. False information from other sources who are benefitting from their own monetary gain is floating around and causing people to deny climate change. Misinformed people who want to help the planet might not know how and could be contributing even more carbon emissions by trying to help. Regardless if they believe in it or not, education through reliable sources have to be distributed throughout the world in order to make changes. It is great that we have this class at UCSB to educate us and allow us to enlighten those around us as well, and hopefully spread this knowledge to more and more people.

There is so much that we can do that will benefit the environment, both individually and collectively. I really enjoyed this lecture video so much and Ken starts by talking about what we can do individually to save the planet from catastrophic environmental damage. I like how he says we are saving the planet for ourselves and all life on it, we need to be compassionate humans and not only care for ourselves, other humans, and other species. Some examples of individual action he gives are to eat largely plant-based diets, and limit our food waste, eat for the good of the planet, and this is one thing that one can do as individuals that have the biggest impact. Another tip Ken gives is to do family planning and educate the other proceeding generations. There are many other things that Ken talks about that one can do to lower their carbon footprint, all sounding very doable. This video made me optimistic, for the first time in this course, all of the individual actions that one can do seem so easy, and not scary, we just need to educate others about what they can do to lower their footprint and not just the members within this class. 
  	<br><br>

Ken goes on to talk about the collective and political action that one can take in order to save the plant. We all have a voice in this world and the plants and animals do not have one, so it is our job to use our voice not only for our species but all the other species. Using our voice can be simply going out and voting for the planet, one only needs to devote 1-2 hours a year to this, 2 hours at most to save the environment, that is all. It is essential to make both individual and collective action towards saving the planet, because if we do not make this shift then we could be facing catastrophic environmental tragedy.

When watching Ken's lecture "Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet", I really enjoyed it and I felt that it was a really good video to present when nearing the end of the course. I liked how it summarizes all that we can do to help prevent climate change. I like that it was also very easy to understand since Ken presents these ideas in terms of a list. I feel that this is very important because I'm no expert in climate change and as we have learned from last week's reading it is very important to present your ideas in a way that is understandable to your audience. I feel that the reading we read last week was exactly how Ken went about teaching this class. When watching this lecture, I realized many of these were repeats from what we learned previously in the quarter. I feel that this is very good because it means that these ways to help prevent climate change will actually stick with me. I also really like the list because many of these things you can do on your own and right now. I think this is very important. I know that there were a few moments in this course where solutions were proposed but were impossible for me to do at that particular moment. I also like how all of the things on the list we went over in a lot of detail throughout the entirety of the course and that they all provide benefits. When looking back on those videos, I still fail to understand how people do not choose to switch to some of these lifestyles because it could possibly end up making them happier than they are now. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and ENGL 22 because it taught me to look at the choices I make very differently. Many of the things on the list, I already do, and some of them I started doing once I took this class and learned about them. I also feel that making these changes has also made me a happier person.

I think that this was my favorite lecture. It perfectly tied everything that we have learned about during this quarter together. I also feel like all of these are things that everyone can do, especially since we live on a college campus. Most of us are already in co-housing apartments and we walk, ride bikes, or take the bus everywhere. All of us are at the voting age and we can also educate our families and friends back home. It is also easy to practice minimalism here because we don't have a lot of space to keep stuff. 
  	<br><br>
I agree with you that Ken's teachings go with the reading from last week. He doesn't over complicate anything and is straight to the point. He doesn't use scientific words that would confuse me. He also gave us ways to reduce our footprint and help the planet rather than just listing all the negative things that climate change will bring about. I really liked this class and have recommended it to all of my friends. It was very interesting and I'm happy to know that I can start acting against climate change right now.


<br><hr>
I agree with you and I also really liked this comprehensive video. I think that having a list is a great way to communicate all the actions that people can take, because each individual can create a different plan to tackle climate change that fits with their lifestyle. I think that having the solutions in this form also makes it easier for people to want to change their habits, because on the ones that they are hesitant about, they can go learn more about why it is actually a good idea. I already implement most of these into my life, being an environmental studies college student, but there are definitely areas of my life where gaining the knowledge from this course was very helpful and compelling. With my biggest problem areas being traveling, and climate communication, this course and these lists have given me powerful tools to turn my knowledge into action.
<br><hr>
I agree with you! I love how this class talks about the climate crisis from different perspectives. And this video is a nice conclusion for what we learned in the past weeks. Ken is  not simply talking about how terrible our climate issues are, he got into many very detailed topics, which changed the concepts of the climate crisis I used to have. I love how he gave out doable solutions that made me feel confident  that we can save our planet by starting with little actions in our daily life step by step. The way he’s teaching is unique but fun. What’s more, I do think this lecture video can be watched and understood by not only people in this class but also outside of this class. I would definitely love to recommend  my  family and friends to watch this video since education about the climate crisis is vital for solving the problem, just like Ken told us.

<br><hr>


I really liked how this video summed up everything that we have been able to learn this quarter. Many of the solutions Ken presented here I find very  manageable and we should all try to make changes. This video does a great job of being able to sum up what we learned in a shorter version, which would be very useful to present to people when try to educate them about climate change. I too find myself already using some of the solutions Ken presents, and I am sure  that can be said for other people too, so I can completely see something like this being done across the world.

I think the most things in this lecture film have already been delivered to us in previous lectures, films, readings and deep-dive lecture discussions. It’s a great satisfaction to see Ken led us go over all these things we’ve been taught again and reinforced the importance of both individual and political actions. It also functions as an abbreviation and summary of the whole climate crisis class that reminds me of what I should or better do to help. The first list actually seems really summative with personal actions ranging from eating habits to transportation, while the second list encompasses more in the premise of political change. There are quite new aspects in this segment, such as reading the truths of the climate crisis and rethinking our positions as inhabitants on the Earth. In my perspective, rather than concluding them in the political section, they should also be in the collective methods of helping our planet. And it is not to say that political appeal is a panacea for all of these crises. Clearly, if you have the controlling power of the politics, every policy will go much more easier into action, but without political control, we can also gain strengths through collective activism and protest. In all, as a summary, this video makes me realize how much I could do after finishing the course and it is not difficult to do something start now on!

I do find these reminders helpful and refreshing. I like to present facts to family and friends, but I always fear providing the wrong statistics or information. With these reinforcements, I view them as a big summary list for what we should know by heart at the end of this quarter. I’m so appreciative and grateful for every single point that Ken discussed. Prior to this course, I might’ve known a couple of them but only at a surface level of understanding. Now, I can proudly say that if a certain topic is addressed, I would be able to engage in a conversation and provide my own opinions based on facts and evidence. I love how certain topics could be divided into more sections such as supporting companies that reinforce fair trade policies, the difference between acts of protest and gathering place, and rethink how we could address this problem by reading and sharing what we know. I do believe that local support is just as important as global support. With local support, we can spread the information and gather people who believe in the cause, then this could be transitioned into a larger scale, hopefully globally and beyond.

I definitely agree!  This was a great summary of this course showing us what we can to to be the change we want to see in the world.  You are so right in saying that this gives us options in what we can do as a solution to the climate crisis.  Just watching this video, I am able to pick out things that I am doing in my life or things that I can easily do in my life.  There are also several things that moving forward in the future I can implement in my life and live my life with the climate in mind.  It’s really inspirational in what a difference you can make within the climate crisis situation.  Overall, I too find optimism in the countless solutions we can use to combat the climate crisis.

I could not have thought of a better video to end this course with. For the past 9 weeks Ken has taught us so many different ways by which we can save the planet, and it was incredible to see this list of “20 things each of us can do to save the planet” and have a deep understanding of each item. I think both lists are equally important and that in order to create “sweeping change”, as Ken would say, it is critical that people are aware of all of these things and educated about the impacts that they can make.  
<br><br>
I just wanted to say a huge thank you to Ken for creating this course and for teaching all of us how to be better inhabitants of this planet. I don’t know many other educators who would take the time to make a 30-video lecture series and I think I speak for everyone in this course when I say that Ken’s own personal actions have inspired us all to be better people. The information provided by this course has really opened my eyes to the magnitude of the climate crisis and has given me hope that through personal/political activism we can, to put it bluntly, save the world.

As this class comes to a close, I wonder how many of us will change. We have had the amazing opportunity to learn about the climate crisis from an elevated and privileged perspective – this is a platform that by sheer luck has granted us the ability to choose how we will live on from here rather than being haltingly suppressed by our governments, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, and so forth as many of our global peers are. As Ken has repeatedly urged us to consider, “Knowledge is not itself power. Knowledge is only power when acted upon. Otherwise, knowledge is power squandered.” Should we all leave this class and decidedly not change our actions, it will have been a failure, regardless of the grade we receive.
<br><br>

I truly hope there are more students who have been inspired and motivated by this content as I have been and will continue to think, speak, and act on the climate crisis long after this course ends.

I have been thinking the same thing. There are about 800 students in this class and I am curious to see how many people actually change their buying, eating, driving and flying  habits. I think that a lot of us cave into the idea that it is pointless to change our ways of living if everyone else continues to eat meat, drive gas-guzzling cars, fly excessively and buy an unnecessary amount of clothes and things. However, in reality, if everyone in this class changed, we could make a significant change and influence other people to change. If we all decided not to fly, that would actually keep some planes from taking off. If we all decided to boycott fast  fashion and explain to 5 of our friends the true cost of the $5 shirt they are wearing, we could maybe actually shift the demand therefore the supply for fast fashion. While individually we all  feel small, helpless and alone in what we're doing to combat the climate crisis, collectively, even just in this class, we could make a lot happen. We just have to get past the idea that if no one else is changing then we shouldn't have to either. Since everyone is thinking this, imagine the power we could have, using what we learned in this course to come together and influence the people around us as a group. 
 <br><br>
I appreciate what you mentioned about how if we leave this class not changing anything about our lives we have failed, regardless of the grade we receive. This is important to consider because a lot of times, especially at a university like ours, people get so caught up in getting the A or having an outstanding GPA that they forget about the real value that comes from the courses we take here, like this one. The climate crisis is MUCH bigger than us and MUCH bigger than our GPA so it should be considered a top priority for us all to take what we can from being able to experience a course like this and do something with what we learn, instead of forget about it all once we fill in the last question on the final exam. All 20 of the things Ken mentions in this video are options for  us all to take from this class and rethink the way we live our daily lives and how we spread the word to other people.


<br><hr>
I have also taught the same about how many of us will change after taking the course. You can see in the lecture that some people are there only for a grade while others are there to actually learn and take action. Too many people are misinformed or uninformed about the situation that it is up to those who know to spread the information. One of the many things that I took from taking this course was that knowledge is useless without action. We are among the few that know the actual severity of climate change and it is up to us to inform others. Ken has given us the knowledge and now we need to take action. Just by showing this video to people it can show them what they can do to help. The 20 ways that Ken mentions are attainable for everyone to do and change for the better. Being politically active carries more weight than just personal changes but the mixture of the two is far more beneficial. We are now the ones who need to take action and inform people about the climate change crisis for the hope that change can happen.

This list is a wonderful wrap up to the course, and serves as a good summary to remind us of the detailed impacts we have learned of throughout this course. Allowing these topics to become our reality takes a lot more than glossing over them in a list of twenty topics, so while the solutions being given so clearly and straightforward is valuable, I am very grateful for the depth we went into so I am able to take each of these points seriously. With all of the attention given to veganism and thrift shopping, these solutions take on the illusion of being a trend, and can be hard to take seriously. It’s comforting to see that the little changes are making true change. I however did not like how little emphasis was put on political change and activism. From what I’ve learned from this class, so much of this issue is rooted in corporate corruption, and realistically, heavily reducing food waste will not do much to prevent fracking and mining. Though personal action will make big changes as the general mass of the public shifts in cultural choices, these companies and capitalistic tendencies will continue until the politics finally fully align with the best decision for our planet.
  <br><br>

I loved the acknowledgement of any field having the ability to work towards a cleaner future. As such an interdisciplinary issue, it is important to be aware of the teamwork that much of the solutions will involve, as it is not solely a political, agricultural, or economical problem. As someone looking for a career in education, I feel it will be an integral part of the necessary change to ensure that the future is making educated decisions in every field. It will be difficult to enact change in the long-standing systems as we know them today, but training professionals of the future of in all different sorts of education as to how they can make changes that can enact large ripple effects is what will be able to confirm to safety of our future.

 I agree that this was a great way to wrap up the course and I am very thankful that Ken consolidated the information from this course in one video for our convenience. I feel like this is the perfect video for sharing with family and friends that we want to spread the word to. I am such a fan of thrift shopping and reusing clothes so I was happy that you placed an emphasis on how it creates true change. I love that my mom saved her wardrobe from the 80’s and I totally utilize it. I also agree that a larger emphasis should have been placed on activism because I feel that the majority of the change that we have already witnessed has come from the activists that were courageous enough to speak up and speak against the habits of humankind. We are inherently greedy and we need to be reminded that we are not the only inhabitants of this planet. I thought it was interesting that the video delineated saving the planet for ourselves vs. saving the planet through a humanitarian perspective. I like to believe that I intrinsically chose to help the planet out of the benefit for generations to come and out of a desire to increase the diversity in biomass. I don't want to be a climatarian just for myself but it does start with ourselves. We are the voices that will be heard in the future and it's our votes that will dictate change in our country. 
     <br><br>
   I wholeheartedly agree that climate change will take a team effort and we need to acknowledge the rising fields that will help combat this crisis. I find it honorable that you want to work in education and I hope that you will play a huge part in the lives of the individuals you educate. I feel that after taking this class you will have the capability of delivering a nonpartisan message to your students about the importance of climate change.

As a political science major, I debated whether or not I should change my major to environmental studies because of my passion towards the climate crisis. This video was certainly one of many things that reminds me why my current major has purpose. I feel that being a political science major exposes me to the ins and outs of our government and why our country functions the way it does in comparison to others. I know that this major, wherever I go in life, is not a useless one in terms of how I can apply my passion towards the climate crisis with it. This current primary season has been almost fun to witness as I now know so much about what is really happening, and how I’ve actually been able to vote for Green New Deal candidates! 
     <br><br>

In terms of the list that Ken also discussed in length, I think that knowing wherever we go in life or what we do is not a determinant of what we CAN do is very important. I feel like approaching the climate crisis is just like approaching a diet. Every diet program I have ever studied (as an athlete here at UCSB) always encourages that one mistake or “bad” meal throughout your day, doesn’t mean you have to throw the whole day away and start your diet again tomorrow. They encourage you to keep up with what your goals are and accept that what you did doesn’t need to ruin your whole day. I think Ken’s first list of 10 things we can do to combat the climate crisis aligns with this. All it takes is a quick daily decision to try and follow as many environmentally conscious steps as possible, knowing that mistakes and imperfections are bound to happen, but not letting those things completely discourage us.

<p>
The more Ken talks about transitioning to a plant-based diet, the easier I find it to try it out. I've been trying to reduce how much meat I eat when I go to the dining commons. I started by not eating meat one Monday, just out of curiosity, then the next day I tried it again since it wasn't so bad the previous day and eventually for a solid week I didn't have any meat and not only did I feel like I was helping the planet but I also felt better health wise. It might sound counterintuitive, but I had more energy, I was able to concentrate better, and I felt like I was gaining less weight. Definitely would recommend people to try this and then see if it works for them instead of pushing the idea  away. Going back to buying unnecessary stuff, just because something is pretty or really cheap doesn't mean you should buy if you don’t need it. Yes,  I understand that people work hard and they decide how to spend their money, however it only damages their wallet and the planet. I’ve had friends that say stuff like, “I don’t need it but I’ll still get it”. I don’t want to ruin their good mood with what I think about that so I just laugh it or smile it off. Of course, now I realize how important it’s to speak up when it comes to saving our planet and preserving natural resources. So, hopefully next time I find the courage in me to speak up when one of my friends says something like this . At this point, there’s no time to be shy when it comes to informing people how their consuming habits are harmful, communication is knowledge.

I totally understand what you're saying about not wanting to ruin the excitement of others when they decide to buy something new without understanding the consequences. I normally do the same thing you do. A laugh or smile and a little guilt is much easier than feeling like a know-it-all that is shoving their beliefs down their friends throats. I think that we should probably look at shopping habits the way we look at smoking. Most people don't hesitate to express how they feel and encourage others to stop smoking because we know it isn't worth it. Shopping is the same way. I should be able to encourage my friend to not practice the "I don't need it but I'll still get it" attitude and recommend less destructive alternatives without feeling like an asshole. For example, IV Trading Post is always giving away really cool clothes that multiple friends and I have gotten real gems out of. Maybe what we need to work on is making sure that we don't tell others how to live, but saying something along the line of, "hey, I saw some really cool free stuff similar to that at the IVTP table the other day". Acting like you want to save your friend money instead of the planet is much cooler for some reason. People don't want morals, they want deals. Manipulate them for the benefit of the planet.

I believe from all the suggestions that Professor Hiltner provided, number six which promotes a minimalistic life is something that I would like to adopt the most. Personally, I have always had the consumerist guilt, which is when I buy something that I really liked at the moment but barely use it on a daily basis. Then, I would also be hesitated to give it away or throw it because many items I bought were quite costly. Thus, I just have a stack of unused things in the corner of my house. Having a minimalist life or even just buying less unnecessary things would make a great change in my life. I would have just enough clothes, items and gadgets, and would not feel guilty when I buy something that I know I would use for years.

A minimalistic lifestyle was also one of my favorite suggestions from this class. I just think it’s so easily achievable. Growing up, I remember my family having things that we thought would be useful or nice to have but after a while became unused. Stuff would pile up in our closet and go untouched and my dad would grow frustrated because my mom didn’t want to throw stuff out just in case it had future value.
     <br><br>
 When I have my own permanent place, I hope to limit my purchases to things that I know will be essential or used extensively. I think it would be nice to live off of just enough. It would take self control, but I think it would be definitely manageable to stop buying excess items or upgrades too often. I have been already practicing using items to their full usage. I used my one backpack all throughout high school until it literally fell apart, and I’ve been trying to stick to my phone from my freshman high school year until it’s completely unusable. I like the idea of fully maximizing the items I own, as it limits the new items I need to buy. I think living more simply allows one to truly appreciate and value everything they own, and that’s a way I’d like to live my life, especially if it benefits our climate as a side effect.

Ken’s point about contraception highlighted how interconnected the climate crisis and social issues are since underdeveloped and poor countries have little or no access to contraception and sex education. As we know, population growth is a huge issue regarding the climate crisis, but in countries where women lack proper education, they aren’t given the tools to succeed. In the perfect world, all women and men would be given and granted equal rights along with reproductive control as Ken mentions. When considering the Green New Deal, I wonder how it would affect social issues such as this one. 

     <br><br>

When Ken mentioned supporting brands with ethical practices it made me think about how these more sustainable products usually are more expensive because of their production and can consequently, make consumers more mindful when buying because we’ll be spending more money on something we’ll keep for a long time rather than doing the fast-paced consumption we take part in now. 

     <br><br>

Overall, this lecture was a great recap of the many ways we can save the planet. Since taking Ken’s English 22 class last quarter, I’ve gone to a climate strike, went to a beach clean up, got involved with two different environmental groups on campus, and voted. Honestly, this is more I’ve done than ever before in terms of climate activism and I’m thankful that being at UCSB has allowed me the opportunity.

I agree with a lot of the points that you made throughout your comment, and found them very interesting. I too believe that this lecture video was a great recap of what this entire course has gone over. After our week one assignment we were all wonder how we could help solve this problem, and as week learned in the weeks that followed one of the easiest and most effective things that we could do is vote. If we go out and vote for the right people that are motivated to set policies in favor of helping our environment we can make a big difference. A big difference could also be made if we were to spread our knowledge to underdeveloped countries that do not have easy access to contraceptives and often are not knowledgeable on the practice of safe sex. In countries where women continue on to higher education, the birth rate is significantly lower. 
     <br><br>
While watching this video I never thought about how organic and sustainable products are more expensive until I read your comment. Due to the price of these products the consumer thinks twice before purchasing them, and weighs the price versus the benefit of the product. We could use this reasoning with the carbon tax that imposes a tax on all carbon products and raises the price of them. Raising the price would make consumers think about buying the product.

I totally didn't like the cliffhanger at the end but overall this is one of Ken's best lectures yet. It was straight forward, to the point, saying exactly what we as students and as humans who are living on this earth should do to save our planet. If you think about it, a lot of the required actions are very simple, e.i bike, live in cohousing, etc. I am sure a lot of us at UCSB are already doing it that just as our lifestyles. It is such a simple solution, really, to just a big problem that could lead to something like the 6th extinction. Sometimes I wonder why we even got into such a mess in the first place. Collective actions, live protests, and civil disobedience, for me at least, is harder to pull off because I am so busy and stuff, but I could definitely see how it can lead to major changes. Voting is a must-have, and tell your friends to vote green, because like Ken said, that 1 hour of voting could play a major factor in government intervention in the climate crisis, giving it the power that it needs. We can't wait for the world to change anymore, we must be the change.

I completely agree that just like Ken mentions, that this is the one video people should watch is any. it gives all the important information that we have discussed and learned about since the beginning of the quarter. I also believe that these are very simple actions that can be done by many but most important should be done soon. These small actions can really mean the difference in saving the planet. Every effort should be made by everyone by watching what they eat, how they travel, and where their votes go. Not only voting politically, but as ken mentions voting with your dollar which is also very important ans can have a huge impact. By knowing where our products come from we can choose to not spend money on companies that are contributing to the death of the planet in order to urge them to change their ways.

At the start of this course I believed that climate change was an issue but really thought about on a singular, more simple level. I thought all we had to do as humans was cut our use of cars and factory production in order to save the planet. I now know that there are many other factors that go into our emissions and that the climate issue is a more complex issue than people realize. I consume a lot of meat (specifically beef) and after learning about how our diets (specifically Americans) drastically affect the climate I have become more conscious to the idea. I have made slow strides into consuming less beef and hopefully soon less meat in general. I also found many interesting facts that I’d assume the general public doesn’t realize either. One such thing was the harm of electric cars. I used to think everyone should just buy a Tesla and we’ll have done a great deal but that is incredibly wrong. I’ve now come to appreciate the use of public transit as it is more beneficial towards our planet compared to the cost of making that brand new car. I loved that I took this class my freshmen year in college because like many I just turned 18 and now allowed to vote. As Ken mentioned, if you struggle to make any of the personal changes to your lifestyle the biggest thing you can then do is vote. I feel as if I took this class at the perfect time with the upcoming presidential election soon to come and now becoming of legal age to vote, I will take action as Ken mentioned and attempt to save our planet.

Same as you, I really like how Professor Hiltner uses this video to wrap everything we have learned in class into a nicely organized video that puts all the puzzle pieces together. As a result, now we have a list of twenty things that we can do to help to improve our environmental problems. While it does seem redundant, since we have been through the nine weeks of lectures, I still want to express my amazement at how much I learned from this course. Just like you, I, too, do not know that consuming beef can be that harmful to the environment. Little did I know how much methane can be released by raising cows, and how many times more dangerous than methane can be compared to carbon dioxide. In addition, I also used to think that electric cars are the solution to everything - it is green, it is clean energy, and it is environmentally friendly. Now, after taking this course, I realize that producing electric cars can cause way too many negative consequences. The course also covers both the personal changes and the political enforcement, which not only educates me on how to start making small changes but also pushed me to realize the importance of getting my voice heard.

This video was a really great way to wrap up the Climate Crisis class. I did not realize how much of an impact this class was going to have on my daily life and thought-process. I signed up for the class because it sounded like a relatively interesting gen-ed, and I will now be ending it with a very changed view on how I live my life. This class brought to my attention the dire consequences facing us if we don’t do something about global warming NOW. It genuinely concerns me that an issue this big wasn’t brought to the forefront of my mind until I took this class, because while I obviously took the time to educate myself for the sake of my grade, many people in and beyond their college years aren’t going to take the time to do the same thing. If I didn’t understand the severity of the climate crisis facing us, I probably would not be enacting any of the changes Ken mentions in this video. However, since I know better, I’ve been very focused on implementing changes like the ones discussed. I’ve given up red meat since we watched Cowspiracy, and I’m hoping to slowly transition to a vegetarian diet overtime. While I haven’t considered going fully plant-based diet yet, I have been trying to at least increase the amount of how much of my meals are plant-based. Every time I go to use my car, I think about if wherever I’m going is really worth the carbon dioxide emissions or if there’s another alternate route for me to get there. Politically, I’ve realized how important it is to support candidates who care for the environment the same way I do (#Bernie2020!). The environment wouldn’t have been very high on my list of political concerns prior to this class, but now it’s an essential factor in how I vote.

<p>
The video was a good summary but I felt like it should have been shorter and more to the point. Some people who want to learn about climate change would probably become bored if they had to watch a 24 minute video about the subject. Rather, I feel like a shorter list containing the most important things we can do about climate change would be better. After watching the video, the most important parts to me were voting, waste and buy less, eat a more plant-based diet, and educate others about climate change. Voting is the most important because our government has the most power to change things. Personal and collective action must work together if we are to change things. We must talk more about climate change to our families, friends, and strangers so that people can become aware of the issue and take action. I also feel like most people think that we can stop climate change with technology like electric cars and solar panels. While better technology is important, eating like a climatarian will do much more in reducing emissions. Ultimately, we must share what we learned in this class with others and take action by voting and living with less. Communicating is important but we must have the willpower to take action if we want to save our planet.

I really like this course and all these lectures because they are not like other videos that only tell us we should reduce carbon emission and protect our environment. This course not only inspires people to act; more importantly, it tells us what we can do to deal with climate change. I believe there are more people who like me that realize climate change is real and is happening but have no idea how to act. This lecture summarizes two lists of ten ways we can do to help mitigate climate change with the first focusing on individual action the second focusing on political and collective actions. I know it is quite hard for us to fulfill all of them but do as much as we can. Take myself as an example, I am an international student, so I’m not allowed to vote. Therefore, I can’t cast my vote for candidates from local to federal advocating for sweeping climate policies. However, I can reduce food waste and change to a largely plant-based diet which can significantly reduce my carbon footprint. I can also start choosing biking or public transportation instead of driving. Moreover, I can practice some form of minimalism, buying things I truly need. Overall, I can do much more than I thought. This lecture tells me that one doesn’t need to be rich or powerful to make a difference. I think this is a very important point. Some people are not willing to take action because they think they don’t have the ability to do so or even if they do so, it is not a big deal to the world. As Peter's friend Rob Greenfield says in the documentary “Being the Change”, "Individual action is every bit as important as a collective action. Together, we can make the world different.”

Ken mentioned that we shouldn’t just save the planet for ourselves, but also for all the other species we co-exist with. I think furthermore we should try to save the planet for generations that we may never even get to meet or witness. I have been doing a lot of readings from Nixon and slow violence and I can’t help but feel that the main reason the majority of the people, especially politicians and people in power, don’t take on the climate crisis isn’t because they don’t believe in it, but I think the main reason is the idea of slow violence. This idea of slow violence relates back to one of Ken’s earlier videos about the slow dripping of oil into a well; at first, you can go years without noticing a difference, but eventually the oil will overflow the well many years later. I think this is the main problem in the way people are thinking about the climate crisis today. Climate deniers are too selfish to think of the future-all they care about is the here and now and the profit of the here and now in their short life span. Imagine how much better life on earth would be if people were able to think about two or three generations down the line and how their actions would affect those to still come- I think this could make all the difference. 
     <br><br>
I found this list very helpful as it reiterated everything, we’ve learned this course and it was a great way to start wrapping the course up. Last year, I chose to stop eating meat in order to help the environment and this year I stopped shopping fast-fashion and I also voted for the first time in my life. I am excited to continue to check off items from this list that will help the environment and I feel encouraged knowing that just a year ago I started trying to lower my carbon foot print and that today, it is lowered in a major way. Change starts one step at a time and speaking from experience, every step becomes easier after that first initial one.

I agree that we should help to save the planet for other animals and future generations. I think it's more important that we save it for other species as they have had nothing to do with this problem and it is totally unfair to them, but also future generations need to be saved from us too. Also the point that politicians and other people in power do believe in climate change is true. These people know that climate change is real, but they just don’t care because it won’t affect them and they can make money out of exploiting the planet.  Lastly, I also found this list very helpful even though it is repetitive since I have been taking this class and also took Eng 22. Yet, this list is very important since it is all in the same place and has the reasons for doing each such thing. It did wrap up the course very well since a lot of people at the beginning of the course were complaining about how Ken wasn’t providing solutions to the problem. Well here they are all in the same place, so now it really depends on us. He did his job, he gave us all the information that we need, so now it's up to us to act on this information. I have started to do some of the things he’s listed such as eating less meat and totally excluding beef from my diet, as well as voting and have even been to a climate rally. These things really aren’t difficult, but you just have to be able to sacrifice a little bit, but that's what it takes to change the world.




</span></div><hr>

<p>
Every one of the 20 solutions is doable. Whether they will be acted upon is a different story. As Ken has stated, unfortunately there are still places around the world where men and women aren’t educated equally due to societal expectations or religious reasons. With time, societal expectations can change, but changing religious views can be much harder. Religion tends to be a sore spot for many and changing it can be the same as changing some people’s identity. This can lead to dangerous situations, but without anyone speaking out, nothing will change. Another spot on his list that can be hard to accomplish is voting for candidates that advocate for climate change. There are other issues in the US that are also important, so voting purely because of climate advocacy would be our folly.

This lecture video really emphasizes the idea that the climate crisis can be manageable, and can be helped if every citizen of the Earth were to band together, and make a decision for change. The fact that this video summarizes so many effective ways to help slow climate change shows just how doable it is. Throughout this course, we have seen time and time again that most climate change deniers, or people who do not actively consider it, often think climate change is overhyped. They often protest against change for the better, because they think it will completely uproot their comfortable lifestyles and overthrow their norm. However, this video makes clear that there will be deep social change, but not as radical as one might think. We can still enjoy travel, but slow travel will become the norm. We can still enjoy the foods we love, but with a climaterian approach to consumption. We can still explore our love of fashion, but through up-cycling and thrifting clothes. When taken in one piece at a time, these lifestyle changes are not so radical, and I am hopeful that people will make decisions to adopt them. What is the harm in making an attempt to better the planet? The worst that can happen is that we’ll end up with happier people, revived ecosystems, and a better quality of life.

I agree with you that the social and cultural change that has to come with fighting the imminent climate crisis is not as radical as it sounds. I think the root of the issue, and what everyone who wants to make a change has to understand, is that we are damaging our planet because of our insatiable hunger for extra, unnecessary "stuff". This need for more things in our lives is putting CO2 into the atmosphere at alarming rates, and is also killing off our biodiversity and mental and physical well-beings while at it. There are so many simple lifestyle changes -- as Ken has shown us all quarter -- that we can make to mitigate our carbon footprint and still live content, comfortable lifestyles. People have to start seeing that these social and cultural changes aren't actually at the expense of their happiness, but rather they will open our eyes to what true happiness is. Sure, some of us will have to sacrifice material luxuries that we may believe give us joy, but the benefits to the planet and our global health and well-being far outweigh the "losses" of these materialistic things. Your point on a better quality of life really hits it home -- we have to choose to live lives with more meaning (deeper relationships with everyone and everything around us) and stray away from the superficial "happiness" of mass consumer culture.

I think you make a good point about not viewing these changes as “radical.” I like how you mentioned that we can still enjoy the things we enjoy now, we would just have to approach them in different manners.  I think by presenting things as extremely radical scares a lot of people, so the way in which we present these solutions is very important. Also, what I liked about Ken’s list was that they impact many different aspects of our life. Also, I would argue that no one is telling anyone to make all these changes right away. That’s the beauty of having such a variety of solutions. You can slowly, one at a time, start incorporating these changes into your life. Even if you take up 1-2 solutions from the list, that is for sure better than doing nothing. I agree with your mindset that there is absolutely no harm in at least trying to create different approaches to our way of living. The one thing I would so thought, is that there still needs to be a lot of change implemented throughout institutions. It really bothers me thinking that all things change we try to implement can be outweighed by the damage that these large corporations cause. How do we make them care like we care? And whilst things can be frustrating, I think it’s important for the rest of society to remember that they still need to do their part. This class has given me hope for a better future with many social and cultural changes being implemented. I hope that in these coming years, we’ll be able to see these changes more clearly and see the condition of our climate improve.

For me, being a climatarian was one of the most appealing personal actions that Ken listed. I think it's a really good middle ground between being environmentally conscious and my regular diet. I wanted to do what I could so I went vegetarian for a little bit but for me personally, it wasn't a good option while being in college. I do however, opt out of red meat as much as I can. I like that I can say I'm still helping the environment in some way by being a climatarian instead of people getting mad at me for being an "environmental studies major" but not being vegan. Apparently some people here think that you have to be an environmental studies major to consider how their personal actions effect the climate crisis. 
     <br><br>
I can definitely see how waste is one of the biggest contributors of emissions. Thinking back to living at home, we wasted a lot of food. We used to regularly throw away food and I couldn't help but think about how much other people would appreciate to have it. It's wasted in the sense that others won't be able to eat and it's also wasted in the sense that a ton of emissions are released for basically no reason. So many emissions are released from the American culture of waste. We waste everything, food, energy, water, etc. We are so privileged and continue to emit so many emissions for stuff that we don't even use. Resources should be used a lot more mindfully, I think that single change in our culture would change so many things for the better.

I strongly agree with you and the professor. After studying environmental protection for a quarter, I really have a great interest in it. First of all, I think this matter is very important. People and environment are interdependent and inseparable. If there are any big problems in the environment, then there is no way for human beings to avoid a certain degree of harm. This is the main reason why I choose to start protecting the environment, and it is also my original intention. For me, English 23 is not only a course, but also motivation for me to change my life. I'm really sorry to see all kinds of natural disasters. If I didn't fly so many times before, if I didn't waste so much food before, if I had noticed that I would turn off the lights at will, would the environment be much better now. Therefore, from this quarter,I noticed all aspects of my life. Don't take too many private cars, don't waste food, and turn off the lights before going out.

I agree that being a climatarian seems like a perfectly realistic change I can make in my life. It seems like a good way to ease into a change in my diet that would be more environmentally sustainable, and I don't have to completely cut out all animal products (which is a pretty drastic change for me). Climatarianism also doesn't come with the stigma of veganism, which means that more people would be willing to try it out. The only thing is, you would have to do a lot of research on what foods are better to eat during which seasons (such as the asparagus example Ken gave in his lecture). I never knew that eating asparagus in the winter is no better for the climate than eating chicken or pork, and most other people probably don't know that either. That is why, as Ken mentioned before,  climate labels on grocery store foods and restaurant menus would be extremely useful and would give people less excuses to ignore certain foods' environmental impacts.
<br><hr>
Thank you for your reply! I agree that climatarianism is also appealing because of its lack of stigma. I had an incident with a family member back during Christmas, I told him I was vegetarian and he told me "that's so LA of you". I told him as many facts I could that I had learned in English 23, this being before the Uncle Pete reading which could have been more helpful. I hate that our actions get undermined into just being fads or what everyone else is doing for no specific reason. Climatarianism shows that we have a specific purpose of wanting to consider our environmental impacts. That's not to say that vegans can't have specific purpose for their diets but I think the name climatarian makes it a lot more clear. I really hope this idea can influence a of people!

As complex and controversial as the climate crisis is, this lecture was concise and effective as it was both greatly informative and persuasive. This course overall was quite the rollercoaster in terms of how I felt about the climate crisis after each reading, film, and lecture, but to see it all pulled together into this comprehensive but not exhaustive list of practical solutions is really satisfying for me. While knowledge isn't power, as Ken mentions in this lecture and previous ones, I do feel more capable with this list and all the information and sources I've learned and gathered while taking this course. Aside from simply knowing more about the issue of climate change, I feel more strongly about the topic as it has turned into a personal issue as opposed to a social or political issue. This shift in perspective is very important to me moving forward as now I can be more vocal about something I not only know more about, but genuinely care about.

I think the list Ken talks about what we can do personally and politically are good steps towards solving the climate crisis although not as effective as major changes such as stopping fracking doing our own part is important. I think that it may seem very small to do things like eat less meat or rent things rather than buy these things, especially if everyone is doing so. I think political action is especially important because they can help make major changes that could help fight the climate crisis at a larger scale which we need since at this pace the planet doesn't have that much time given how much damage it has endured over the decades. I think that from all the information I have learned from this course and the various sources provided by Ken I have learned so much about the climate crisis, society, the concept of happiness, individual power and the power we can have from uniting. I definitely think that the way I see everyday life has changed and has made me aware of more issues and more conscious of my decisions. Knowing what I know now has made me want to set up personal goals such as eating a lot less meat, being conscientious of food portions to eliminate food waste, biking more places, reusing things more rather than quickly throwing it away and educating others more about these issues.

In this lecture, Ken’s list of 20 items--10 being personal actions the other 10 collective/political action--effectively overviewed much of what we have learned throughout this course. His solutions that catered towards each scope of action--personal, political, and collective--was thorough and well explained. Even though we partially know components of this list by taking the class, I agree with Ken that this is the best video to show someone else in that it truly covers and explains so much in regards to facilitating solutions to the crisis. We should all be working to incorporate items on the list into our everyday lives.
<br><br>
The solutions Ken mentions are primarily for developed countries, which makes sense because it’s the developed countries that have wreaked the most damage to our planet. However, it would be interesting to know how someone in a developing country who wants to be more environmentally conscious and proactive. Would there be a 20 item list? Would it be significantly shorter? Would it be more or less politically based? Regardless, Ken did an excellent job in outlining a variety of concepts we should all be collectively considering and striving to achieve.

I agree! I thought this video was fantastic, and Ken effectively summarized a list of actions that we can take to fight the climate crisis. I liked how in the beginning, he stated that we are saving the planet not just for the sake of its well-being, but for the sake of humanity as well. 
<br><br>
There were a lot of solutions Ken mentioned, but there were quite a few that stood out for me the most. The first was when he argued that we need to fairly educate both boys and girls, and more girls and women across the globe need to be educated on population growth and the use of contraceptives. Ken is absolutely right in that more women, particularly in third-world countries, need to be educated so that they understand their right to decide whether to give birth and should not be forced to do so. Ken calls this situation a "Win-Win-Win".
<br><br>
I also liked when Ken brought up that saving the planet begins at home, and this includes a wide variety of solutions, such as reducing the amount of food waste left from our dinner tables, switching to a climatarian diet, and purchasing clothing from environmentally friendly companies. Ken does admit that although changing our lifestyles can be difficult to adapt to at first, it is important that we do this with a minimalist mindset.


<br><hr>
I agree with you, this video was a great summary of everything we have talked about in this course and its quite easy to understand so I could see myself showing this to people I know so that they could also be informed.  His solutions are nicely laid out in the ways that you could implement them in your life. But I also completely agree with you that these solutions are aimed toward developed countries which affect our planet the most with greenhouse gases which we have seen as well as aimed toward middle class families and higher so I would also like to see how changes could be implemented in developing countries.

<br><hr>
I think you’re spot on! This video is definitely the one that I would choose to show my parents if they asked what I learned in this class because it, like you aforementioned, combines the personal, political and collective change we need to undergo to solve this problem. Additionally, in regard to the question you posed in the latter half of your argument, I believe that for someone in a developing country, their list of things they could do would look much different. We can't expect a society to decrease their fossil fuels use when they are trying to get themselves out of poverty. Increasing  developing countries' standard of living through fossil fuels may hurt the environment, but it would be extremely unfair to restrict this growth from happening. Because of this, it is the job of countries equal to the United states in economic prominence to change themselves first and be leaders in the global threat of climate change.

The summarization of solutions we can do not only served as a great review but also gave me something to go off of when educating my friends and family. What I liked most about this list was the ideas are so simple and easy that it isn't unattainable for the average American to be able to do the majority of them. The only reason a huge part of the population isn't on board is they are either uninformed or misinformed about the state of our planet. I do feel like some conversations on this list will take longer to get correct justice such as women's reproductive rights. It is astonishing to me how  not only are we still struggling to give women full control over themselves in 2020 but that it also connects to climate change so much it has to be added to a solutions list. The importance of educating is huge amongst families or those closest to you. Ken's example of Greta challenging her parents to live a more sustainable life was something I could relate to. Once I became a vegetarian my family took the reasons I explained for it more seriously. They have now changed a lot of ways which has also saved us a lot of money and time also. After taking this class makes me realize how much cheaper it is to live sustainably and those who don't are going out of their way to be wasteful and ignorant. I see a lot of this ignorance when I travel home as a lot of people refuse to adjust their lifestyle to prove a political point. While it is sad, I do have hope that eventually everyone will make the change.

The 20 things that we as people can do to save the planet do not involve any technology and it is achievable if everyone where to be educated on the issue and as Ken mentioned, if they used the knowledge to take action. The most important thing that people can do is vote, as this is the way to force people to change their behaviors and actions through the imposition of carbon taxes. However, people need to be educated on the people they are voting for so that real change is enacted and we have people who are looking out for the people and not big corporations. A lot of the solutions mentioned are things that we have already discussed in class like educating girls because the more educated they are, the less children they have. A lot of pregnancies are unplanned and this is because people do not have access to contraceptives or the knowledge/resources to practice safe sex. We can make simple changes in our lives by being more conscious of the things we do. This means being aware of the things we do like the choices we make to eat, where we live, and our consumer culture. We need to limit ourselves on the amount of things we buy and recycle and repair thing instead of throwing things out and replacing them. Another important thing that we can do is communicate with people about the seriousness of the climate crisis and become activists who demand change.

We talked a lot in this class about hope. Whether or not there is hope for the climate crisis. Whether or not there is hope for us as humans. Whether or not there is hope that our lives will be be better or worse as a result of the changes that the climate crisis will bring. This video gives me hope. When tangible changes are put into words, clear as day for anyone to see, then there is hope in the fact that as a civilization we can persevere through this crisis. Why not just hope--if there are changes that can come. But maybe even using the word hope is wrong in the first place. Maybe we have no choice but to persevere through this, we can't afford to hope. Without that we are left with just one option: action. If we are to survive this then hope will not be enough. We can only act. We can only set our lives out to try and survive the greatest problem this world will have ever seen. If we are to be able to survive past this crisis then we will need to act. We will need to work together. We will need to recognize the scale of this problem and do something about it. Do not do anything is to wish death upon us and upon our children.

The freegan is a great concept not only for the planet but also for individuals. People always believe more represents better. However, only suitable food can max the joy of eating. Unless the person has psychic trauma, such as always starving in childhood or lack of safety, the excess food is always bad for the joy of eating. People either are uncomfortable due to being too full or are anxious about the food they can not consume. Being a freegan also can help every individual financially. 
<br><br>


Equal education benefits the world not only environmentally but also generally. However, the composition, of course, should be optimized, especially before college. The school should teach students how to think individually and how to access and analyze the information instead of just showing one perspective of the fact and simply force the student to accept it.

<p>
This lecture made me realize that there is so much that I can do for our environment. The twenty things we can do include: 1. eat a plant-based diet (vegan or freegan) and limit food waste 2. be conscious with your food choices (ex. it's harmful to eat asparagus in the winter) 3. use contraception 4. educate boys and girls fairly 5. walk or bike instead of driving, or use a car minimally 6. live mindfully (in smaller homes, micro-apartments, or co-housing) 7. choose slow travel (driving, trains) over air travel 8. practice some form of minimalism (only buying what you need) 9. repair, trade, or rent instead of buying new things 10. buy from companies with environmentally-sound and socially just practices 11. vote for candidates who advocate for sweeping climate policies 12. vote for environmental initiatives 13. tell people about the climate crisis, explain the solutions and the importance of voting 14. gather and create powerful groups of activists and change-makers 15. protest and take power away from enemies of the environment 16. read and educate yourself about skills you can take on 17. think about why this is so important in order to maintain or revitalize your passion for the cause 18. use knowledge to share and implement solutions 19. join with initiatives such as freegan and bicycle collectives to create a larger support system for the climate crisis 20. become the change you want to see in the world. Hopefully we as a society can follow these guidelines and make a real difference in the world. I think this list was extremely informative and I will try to follow it.

Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet
 <br><br>
First, the title already pulls my attention because I think there will many useful information and practical for people to dealing to climate crisis. Based on the current situation of the climate, people could change their lifestyles to affect climate issue. Saving the plant relates to food waste, 15% of carbon emission is for food consumption. Plate-based diet is healthier not only for human bodies but also to the planet. Besides, there are many countries that still suffers from poverty and food shortage. People who have better living standards should not ignore such facts. Although it might sound cruel to discourage people to have babies, it is relevant that growing household size is causing many resources consumption and create more carbon footprint. While recap the information I retrieved from this course, I have better and more comprehensive understanding about climate crisis: the definitions, various theories, advices etc. Before the course, I thought electric car is better than regular gasoline car since it is “greener” without carbon gases emission. However, the lifetime of electric car is way shorter than regulars, which will encourage consumers to purchase more cars in their lifetime that cause more waste. Overall, this course is very interesting to me.

The lecture, “Pulling it all together: 20 things that each of us can do to save the planet”, was very formative and gave good solutions on how to improve the conditions that we are inb. I agree that we need to improve our diets and minimize the intake of meat and also reflect our actions on how to make a positive impact on the planet. I was surprise  on the high percentage of the amount of pregnancies and how we need to educate women and make sure that they know all the possibilities on how to take care of themselves and more aware of sex educartion. I also was surprised how in the video it mentions that 19/20  have not been on a plane. Where I am from, there are always people traveling  and necessity  for work. I also am more encouraged to be more involved in the voting side of things. I felt like my vote didn’t matter and this class taught me that any small action can make a  big difference. I am now aware that any vote matters and can make a  huge difference. I am encouraged to be more involved and star voting.

I think a proper summary in the course was the video of this week on the 20 steps that each individual can reduce carbon emissions and contribute to helping with the climate crisis. This provided the class directly with an excellent summary of the course material over the past 9 weeks. I think it also offers a unique forum for ordinary citizens to take action and help out with the climate crisis rather than reading and collecting multiple news sources that could possibly include fake news. This gives us the most prestigious courses and refreshes us with all the steps we can take to achieve an environmentally sustainable lifestyle.

<p>

I think this lecture was a great summary of English 23. Each of the 20 actions mentioned seem completely reasonable, especially for the developed world. While some people may not be able to do all 20, this gives them the option to do as many as possible and know that they are making a contribution to slowing climate change. I also think it's great that so many of the things on the list involve working with others to help create change; whether you talk to some friends about climatarianism or march at the forefront of climate change related protests, you are spreading a valuable message. Moreover, it's important to see that individual actions -- like changing your diet, flying less and using reusable products -- are a good place to start, but that they must be supported by political action. If any environmentalist wants to actively change the system of agriculture, fossil fuels and travel, we need support from those who make laws and influence millions of citizens: the government. 
 <br><br>

We need to get the ball rolling. Like Ken said, saving the planet begins with us. In the 8 weeks of this course, so far, we have been presented with many options on how we can act against climate change. We need to put those into practice. It doesn't matter where we start, but it matters that we start soon.

I agree, this lecture took all the key points that were made in previous lectures and summed it up within a half hour. I also see the reasoning you used by saying that people should strive to make all 20 changes if they could meet at least 10 then the world would indeed be better off. The examples used in the lecture are all mostly individual decisions that we can all make however some of them are compounded when many individuals makes them together, as this is truly when a real change can be detected. Furthermore once large groups make changes elected officials then begin to make laws and bills that best serve their constituents, and in order to be reelected they would have to enact laws to prevent climate change. Even before this though we can put politicians in office to proactively reflect the peoples views rather than current politicians retroactively changing to reflect their constituents. I also really liked your last comment as I believe it sums up the message of this class nicely. It doesn't matter what or how much you do to combat climate change, just at lease do something and do it soon. This is a great message to spread to those in a quick efficient way to let them know how to combat climate change.


<br><hr>
I wholeheartedly with Julia regarding the status of this video as a summary of English 23. These twenty actions are not only the main points of the class itself but play an essential role in the altering of societal norms to better accommodate climate change. As for these twenty points and their relationship to the developed role, I believe that it is required to pay special attention to how they are completely shifted to relate to our present day society. Realizing that we as a developed society take for granted the capabilities of our societal norms in relation to other places in the world but also their environmental impacts. Changing American culture as a whole will be nothing close to easy or even mediocre, but education on these twenty things and their impacts is more than a step in the right direction. Like Julia exclaimed, even if one person can not actively change their life to accommodate all twenty of these things that we can do, even half or as many as possible is nonetheless significant to the battle against the growing issue of climate change. I myself expected that Ken at least briefly touch on the impact of anti climate change writing and the production and distribution of such writings. Julia’s mention of the power of collaborative approaches to climate change activism and action greatly highlighted just how important not only individual actions are but also the importance of others actions. One person can successfully complete all twenty of these things but their actions alone unfortunately can not make the change we need to see. To continue, the great importance of individual actions being geared to political activism was something I did not necessarily expect half of the twenty to be focused less on personal action. WIth that said, it opened my eyes to the many approaches to how to help save the planet (and ourselves) and the importance of each one. Saving the planet begins with us but can not end with us. It is also our duty if we want to create an effective impact to being with ourselves and extend our effect as far as we can. Just like Julia said, it doesn't matter what we start with as long as we do. This course has opened my eyes to climate change and the issues that arise with it but luckily presented me with almost too many ways to take action.

<br><hr>
I agree with you in the way that this video does summarize this climate crisis class very well. Finally, it is nice to hear some solutions and alternatives to normalized Western life that we Americans live. I think it's really messed up that companies are pouring millions of dollars to confuse the public on whether climate change is real. I've been reading  and taking this class to become educated on this issue, but many people don't have this advantage. People don't know what to do or how to act about the predicament with the rising temperature levels. After taking English 22 and English 23 I have become a vegetarian. Changing my diet not only allows me to help myself and the environment, it also allows me to speak of my change. Many people ask me why I suddenly became vegetarians and it gives me the chance to explain the horrendous beef industry. This leads to me talking about deforestation and ultimately climate change. By speaking of our contribution to using less fossil fuels, we are able to educate the public.
 <br><br>


Ken spoke of alternatives that include: not wasting a lot, using public transportation, voting, and eating a more plant-based diet. All of these changes are doable by all Americans. Public transportation is difficult in California because the system is so limited in places of transportation. If we speak up and vote for leaders who want to evoke change then we can help the planet! EVERYONE MATTERS!


<br><hr>
I agree that the actions Ken has described are manageable for a vast number of people. Most importantly, I think the way that he outlined these actions tells us which ones to prioritize. Switching to a vegan lifestyle is a huge change and incredibly admirable, yet it's not enough to bring our population's emissions down enough. Veganism, Freeganism, Flexitarianism, voting, using public transportation, avoiding air travel, discussing the global issue, and more are plenty of ways that we can personally do the most we possibly can, given there are limitations to doing it all, like Peter Kalmus. However, these personal changes being adopted into larger communities in combination with activism will show our government the bigger changes that we want to see. It's a ripple effect. We must start small and work outward. We can and have already started doing many of these things, we now just need to make these practices more common by communicating with others. There's definitely more that each person can do individually, but I believe that we are already being the change and we must remain consistent in our actions and hopeful in practice.

<br><hr>
I agree, this lecture was a great recap of English 23 so far. Throughout the course, we have talked about many personal and political actions we can take to mitigate the crisis. This lecture video effectively puts all the ideas together into a cohesive segment. I will definitely be showing this video to my family and friends.
 <br><br>

A lot of the recommended actions mentioned in this video seem like common sense. However, it is good to have a reminder once in a while. I think this video could have a very positive impact on people. The next time I think about buying a new shirt or throwing away my half-eaten banana, I am more likely to remember this video and change my actions accordingly. The biggest takeaway from this video is that the smallest actions can make the biggest difference. In Copenhagen, many personal actions and caused the entire city to switch to bikes as the main method of transportation. I believe that each of the individual changes mentioned in this lecture can create a domino effect that can lead to major changes.
